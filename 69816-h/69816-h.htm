<h3><span class="smcap">Acts</span> xxiv. 24, 25.</h3>

<p><i>After certain days, when Felix came with his
wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent
for Paul, and heard him concerning the
faith of Christ. And, as he reasoned of
righteousness, temperance, and judgment to
come, Felix trembled, and answered</i>, <span class="smcap">Go
thy way for this time; when I have a
convenient season, I will call for thee</span>.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">This</span> Felix, whose name is become so memorable
in the Christian church, had been
made Procurator of Judæa by the Emperor
Claudius, and continued in that government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
during the six or seven first years of Nero:
when he was recalled to answer for his oppressive
administration before the emperor; who,
we are told, would have punished him, according
to his deserts, but for the interposition of
Pallas, at that time Nero’s chief minister.</p>

<p>He was, indeed, in all respects a very corrupt
and profligate man, as appears from the testimony
of Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and Josephus<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; from whom
we learn, that he was more especially addicted
to the vices of <i>lust and cruelty</i>; both which
he exercised in the most audacious manner;
vexing the people with all sorts of oppression,
and rioting in his excesses, without restraint.
Drusilla, too, is represented to us in a light,
not much more favourable. For, though a
Jewess, and the wife of another man, she had
contracted a marriage, or rather lived in adultery
with this pagan governor of Judæa; transgressing
at once both a moral and positive law
of her religion, for the sake of ascending to
that honour.</p>

<p>One would wonder how persons of this character
should have any curiosity to <i>hear Paul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
concerning the faith of Christ</i>. And, without
doubt, they had no serious desire of information.
It is likely they proposed to themselves
some entertainment from questioning the prisoner;
and the presence of Drusilla makes it
credible that the entertainment was chiefly
designed for <i>her</i>; who might be a bigot to her
religion, though she scorned to live up to it;
and therefore wanted, we may suppose, to insult
Jesus in the person of his disciple.</p>

<p>However, let their purpose be what it would,
such were <span class="smcap">Felix</span> and <span class="smcap">Drusilla</span>, before whom
Paul <i>reasoned of righteousness, temperance,
and a judgment to come</i>.</p>

<p>Paul was not in the number of those complaisant
preachers, who take a text, in which
their hearers have no concern. He had to do
with persons, who bade defiance to religion in
all its forms; and his subject was well suited
to the occasion. They expected an amusing
tale of Jesus Christ: but the Apostle, who
knew how unworthy they were of being instructed
in the faith, as not yet possessing the
fist principles of morals, took up the matter a
great deal higher; and, discoursing to them
on the natural duties of justice and temperance,
which they had grossly violated, and on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
natural doctrine of a judgment to come, which
they had never believed or respected, gave
them to understand, that they had much to
learn, or practise at least, before they were fit
hearers of what he had further to say concerning
the Christian revelation.</p>

<p>Being taken at this advantage, we may easily
conceive their surprise and disappointment:
and, as the speaker knew how to give an
energy to his discourse on these interesting
topics, we cannot wonder, that one or both of
them should be much discomposed by it. Of
Drusilla the sacred text says nothing: she was,
perhaps, the more skilful dissembler of the
two; or her rage and indignation might, for
the moment, get the better of her fears: but
Felix had not the address, or the fortune, to
disguise his feelings; he <i>trembled</i> before this
plain, intrepid speaker.</p>

<p>This event is instructive, indeed, as it sets
before us the power of conscience over the
worst of men; and, at the same time, the
meanness of guilt, which, in such place and
dignity, could not help shrinking at the voice
of truth, though speaking by the mouth of a
poor dependant prisoner. But when we have
made the proper use of these reflexions, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
case of Felix, we shall find a still more instructive
lesson in <i>the subsequent conduct of
this affrighted sinner</i>.</p>

<p>When the fit of trembling came upon him,
he said hastily to the preacher: <i>Go thy way
for this time; when I have a convenient season,
I will call for thee.</i></p>

<p>How striking a picture of that fatal disposition
which men have to put off repentance,
even under the fullest conviction of guilt; and
that too, on the most frivolous pretences!
What Felix should have done instantly, when
his conscience was so much alarmed, he omits
to do: <i>Go thy way for this time</i>: and yet, to
quiet that conscience, he would not be thought
to lay aside all purpose of reformation: <i>When
I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</i></p>

<p>With this famous example in my eye, I shall
attempt to shew in the following discourse: 1.
<i>That</i> <small>PROCRASTINATION</small> <i>is the usual support of
vice</i>: 2. <i>That false reasoning</i>, or, what we
may call, <i>the</i> <small>SOPHISTRY OF VICE</small>, <i>is the great
support of procrastination</i>: 3. That a <small>FINAL
IMPENITENCE</small> is the too common effect of this
pernicious confederacy. And</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Procrastination</span> is the main support of
vice; the favourite stratagem, by which the
grand deceiver himself ensnares the souls of
men, and maintains his empire over them.</p>

<p>There are few persons so desperately wicked
but they resolve, secretly at least, and in their
own minds, to amend their bad lives, at some
time or other. But that time is rarely the
present. They have other business in hand:
some scheme of interest to manage, some project
of ambition to pursue, some intrigue of
pleasure to accomplish; in short, some darling
sin or other to gratify, before they can be at
leisure to execute this intended work of reformation.</p>

<p>Nay, there are seasons of recollection, in
which the memory of their past lives afflicts
and torments them; there are hours of melancholy,
or ill health, in which the necessity of
repentance seems pressing and instant; there
are certain moments of terror, in which the
final resolution is on the point of being taken:
yet still, this delusive idea of <i>to-morrow</i> steps
in: the memory, the necessity, the terror, are
over-ruled: the ungrateful task is, for the present,
deferred; to-morrow laid aside, and the
next day forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>This was the case of Felix in the text.
When bad men are clothed with power, it is
not easy for truth of any kind, especially for
moral truth, to gain access to them. Yet it
made its way to this potent governor, and with
a force which nothing could resist. It borrowed
the thunder of Paul’s rhetoric to speak
home and loudly to his affrighted conscience.
It shook his guilty mind with the sense of his
crimes, his incontinence and injustice, his riot
and rapine, his lust and cruelty; and still more,
with the apprehension of <i>a judgment to come</i>,
armed with terror, and ready to take vengeance
of his multiplied iniquities.</p>

<p>You expect now, that, in this agony, he
should take the part, which duty and prudence,
his conviction and his fears, equally
recommended to him. You expect, that he
should apply to his instructor, who had raised
this storm, to compose it; and that, leaving
his chair of state, he should spring forth and
accost his prisoner, as the honest jaylor at Philippi
had done, on a similar occasion: <i>What
must I do to be saved<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>?</i> But, no; it was not
yet convenient to put that question. His
pleasures, his fortune, his ambition, might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
endangered by it. It was not the moment to
take this decisive step. Better to think twice
of it, and dismiss the preacher <i>for this time</i>.</p>

<p>And is there nothing in this case which we
may apply to ourselves? Is there none here,
whom the free remonstrance of a friend, an unexpected
sentence in a moral writer, the admonition
of a preacher, and, above all, the <i>word
of God</i>, hath, at any time, awakened to a
lively sense of his condition? A reproof from
one or other of these sometimes falls in so exactly
with a man’s own case, and goes so directly
to the heart, that he is more than commonly
disturbed and confounded by it. It
flashes such conviction on the mind, and shews
the sinner to himself in so just a light, that he
stands aghast at the deformity of his conduct,
and at the peril of it. In the agitation of this
distress, he half resolves to repent: nay, he
strives for a moment to enforce this good resolution:
when, let but that dæmon, which
every sinner carries about with him, whisper
the word, <i>to-morrow</i>, and his conscience revives,
his fears disperse, and this precious opportunity
is lost, though at the hazard of never
returning any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>Not that he permits this idle insinuation to
banish all thoughts of future repentance, or to
prevail with him, for the present, in its true
and proper form: No: to be thus far the dupe
of his own folly, would disgrace him too much,
and expose his prevarication too plainly: if it
pass upon him, it shall be under the mask of
wisdom. He turns sophister then in his own
defence, and is easily convinced, “That his
conduct is not altogether absurd or unreasonable.”</p>

<p>And thus, as I proposed to shew,</p>

<p>II. In the next place, this fatal procrastination,
which supports vice, is itself supported
by a <small>READY AND CONVENIENT SOPHISTRY</small>.</p>

<p>The case of Felix will again illustrate this
second observation; and shew us the whole
process of that preverted ingenuity, by which
the credulous mind is made easy under its delusion.</p>

<p>He thought it not sufficient to say to Paul;
<i>Go thy way for this time</i>. This abrupt dismission
of the preacher was to be justified, in
some sort, to himself, and to those who were
witnesses of his consternation. He covers it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
then, with this pretence; <i>When I have a convenient
season, I will call for thee</i>.</p>

<p>The <small>TIME</small>, it seems, was not proper for his
immediate conversion. To become a penitent
just then; on the instant; to be surprised into
a good life, had the appearance of too much
facility and inconsideration. He must take a
space to reflect on the grounds and reasons of
what had been offered to him. He had, besides,
other affairs, which pressed upon him at this
moment: or, if not, to deliberate on the matter,
would render his conversion more solemn
and effectual.</p>

<p>The <small>PLACE</small>, too, we may believe, was as little
suited, as the time, to this business. “What!
in a public apartment of his palace! in the
presence of Drusilla, whose tenderest interests
were concerned in the case, and whose delicacy
required managing! before his pagan courtiers,
and many, we may suppose, of his Jewish
subjects, who would be equally scandalized at
this precipitate conversion of their master and
governor!” These, and other pretences of the
like sort, without doubt, occurred to him: and
on the strength of these he concludes his procrastination
to be fit, and decent, and justifiable,
in a good degree, on the principles of virtue
and prudence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>“But why, unhappy man (if one may presume
to expostulate the case with thee) why
this hasty and unweighed conclusion? Could
there be any time more convenient for thy conversion,
or any place more suitable, if thou
wert in earnest to be converted?</p>

<p>Wast thou ever so prepared for this change
as now? Was thy mind ever so convinced, or thy
heart so affected? Didst thou ever hear and
<i>tremble</i> till this day, and wilt thou expect such
a miracle a second time? Can thy bad life be
reformed too soon, or can it need an afterthought
to justify such reformation? Can any
other business come in competition with this?
and can it deserve the name of weakness and
surprise to give way to the powerful workings of
thy own conscience? In a doubtful case, it may
be well to deliberate: but can it be a secret even
to thyself, that nothing is questionable here,
but thy sincerity?</p>

<p>For what, let me ask, is that <i>convenient
season</i>, which flatters thy present irresolution?
Wilt thou find such a monitor, as Paul, in thy
dependants? Will thy tax-gatherers preach
<i>righteousness</i> to thee, and thy centurions,
<i>temperance</i>? or, thy philosophers (if, perhaps,
thou hast of these about thee, to grace thy provincial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
pomp) will they reason with thee, on a
<i>judgment to come</i>?</p>

<p>But the <small>PLACE</small> is unfit; and thou wilt send
for Paul to confer in private with thee.</p>

<p>Wast thou then afraid to expose thy honour
by this step? And did it seem too much to give
to God and truth, the glory of thy conversion?
True penitence knows nothing of these punctilios.
The example had edified thy unbelieving
court; and might have had its effect on the
insensible Drusilla. Thy injustice and incontinence
had been open to all men. Was it not fit
thou shouldst atone for this scandal by as public a
reformation? Yet still thy pretence is, <i>a convenient
season</i>! As if the first season, that offers
for renouncing a bad life, were not always the
most convenient.”</p>

<p>But I continue this address to the Roman
governor too long, if you consider me as directing
it to him only. Let me profess, then, that
by Felix I mean every sinner at this day, who
procrastinates in the affair of his salvation, and
would colour that procrastination by a still
more contemptible sophistry. For, let us be
ingenuous. This miserable Pagan, after all,
had something to say for himself. This was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
probably, the only time that repentance had
ever been preached to him. He still, perhaps,
was acquainted with little more than the name
of Jesus: for his teacher, as we have seen, insisted
chiefly on the great truths of natural religion.
If he then scrupled to take the benefit of
this first and imperfect lecture, there is some
allowance to be made for his folly. But what
shall we say of those who possess every possible
advantage of light and knowledge, who have
grown up in the profession of Christianity, and
are not now to learn either its duties or terrors?
If such as these have sinned themselves into the
condition of Felix, and yet resist the calls of
grace, the commands of the Gospel, the exhortations
of its ministers, the admonitions of
their own conscience, all of them concurring to
press upon them an immediate repentance; if
there be among us such procrastinators as these,
what topics of defence are there by which they
can hope to excuse, or so much as palliate,
their prodigious infatuation?</p>

<p>“Shall we say for them, or will they say for
themselves, that they are young and healthy?
that they have time enough before them, in
which to grow wise at their leisure? that they
wait till the boisterous passions have been
calmed by reason and experience? that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
expect <i>a convenient season</i> for repentance, in
declining life, and the languor of old age? or
that they shall find it, as others have done, on
the bed of sickness, or on the bed of death?”</p>

<p>I have never heard that Christians have any
better reasons than these for delaying repentance:
and, if they have not, though the
sophistry of Felix deserved to be laid open, the
respect I owe to those who now hear me, will
not permit me to imagine that such sophistry
as this, can want to be exposed.</p>

<p>It will be to better purpose to set before
you,</p>

<p>III. In the last place, the issue of this too
natural alliance between procrastination and
vice, in a <small>FINAL IMPENITENCE</small>; of which the
case of Felix, again, affords us a striking
example.</p>

<p><i>When I have a convenient season</i>, says he
to Paul, <i>I will call for thee</i>. This season
came, and Paul attended; to what effect, we
shall now understand.</p>

<p>When Felix dismissed him from his presence,
he insinuated, nay perhaps thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
that he should have a disposition hereafter to
profit by his religious instructions. But time
and bad company quieted his fears: and a
favourite vice inspired other motives for the interview,
than those of religion. <i>For he hoped</i>,
says the historian, <i>that money should have
been given him of Paul, that he might loose
him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener,
and communed with him</i>.</p>

<p>The case, we see, is well altered. He
<i>trembled</i> before at Paul’s charge against him of
rapine and extortion: he would now exercise
these very vices on Paul himself. Such was
the fruit of that <i>convenient season</i>, which was
to have teemed with better things!</p>

<p>But this is not all: <i>For, after two years
Portius Festus came into Felix’s room; and
Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure,
left Paul bound</i>.</p>

<p>Felix then had his preacher within call for
<i>two whole years</i>: time sufficient, one would
think, to afford the opportunity of many a
lecture <i>concerning the faith of Christ</i>. Yet,
though he communed with Paul oft, it does
not appear that his conferences with him
turned on this subject. What he wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
draw from him was, not truth, but money;
and, when this hope failed, he was little concerned
about the rest. Nay, the impression
which Paul had made upon him was so entirely
effaced, that he left an innocent man <i>in bonds</i>,
for the sake of <i>doing a pleasure to the Jews</i>.
But he had his reason still for this unwonted
courtesy. For their complaints were ready to
follow him (as indeed they did) to the throne
of Cæsar; whither he went, at last, unrepentant
and unreformed, to encounter, as he could,
the rigors of imperial justice; just as so many
others, by the like misuse of time and opportunity,
expose themselves to all the terrors of
divine.</p>

<p>Not but there is yet this advantage in the
parallel on the side of <i>Felix</i>. He neglected to
use the space of <i>two years</i>, which was mercifully
allowed him for the season of reformation:
but how many Christians omit this work, not
for <i>two</i> only, but for twenty, forty years; nay,
for the whole extent of a long life; and never
find a <i>convenient season</i> for doing the only
thing, which it greatly concerns them to do,
although with the astonishing delusion of
always intending it.</p>

<p>To conclude: We have seen that procrastination
serves the ends of vice; and that vice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
in return, is but too successful in pleading the
cause of procrastination: leaving between them
this salutary lesson to mankind, “That he who
seriously intends to repent to-morrow, should
in all reason begin to-day; <i>to-day</i>, as the
Apostle admonishes, <i>while it is called to-day,
lest the heart</i>, in the mean time, <i>be hardened
through the deceitfulness of sin</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<h2 id="SERMON_XXX">SERMON XXX.<br />
<span class="medium">PREACHED DECEMBER 19, 1773.</span></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">1 John</span> v. 11.</h3>

<p><i>And this is the record that God hath given to
us, eternal life; and</i> <small>THIS LIFE IS IN HIS SON</small>.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">We</span> are indebted to the Gospel for the knowledge
and hope we have of eternal life; this
important doctrine having, <i>first</i>, been delivered
by Jesus Christ, and <i>only</i> by him, on any
proper grounds of authority. This then is the
<i>record</i>, or the substance of what the Gospel
<i>testifies</i> and affirms, <i>That God hath given to
us eternal life: and this life</i>, adds the Apostle,
<small>IS IN HIS SON</small>: that is, he <i>procured</i> this
blessing for us; he is not only the teacher, but
the <i>author</i> of eternal life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>This last is a distinct and very momentous
consideration. Reason might seem to have
some part in discovering, or at least in confirming,
the doctrine itself: but the <i>manner</i>
of conveying the inestimable gift of eternal life,
whether <i>immediately</i> from the giver of it, or
by the <i>mediation</i> of some other, this is a matter
of pure revelation; and reason hath nothing
more to do in the case, than to see that the
revelation is, indeed, made, and then with all
humility to acquiesce in it.</p>

<p>Being, then, to treat this sublime subject,
<i>the redemption of mankind through Christ</i>, I
shall do it simply in the <i>terms</i> of scripture, or
at least with a scrupulous regard to the plain
and obvious <i>sense</i> of them. The text says,
<i>eternal life is in the Son of God</i>; and my discourse
must be merely a <i>scriptural comment</i> on
this declaration.</p>

<p>Now, the scripture teaches, that immortality
was originally, and from the beginning,
the free gift of God to man, on the condition
of his obeying a certain law, or command,
prescribed to him: whether that command be
interpreted <i>literally</i>, of not eating the fruit of
the forbidden tree in paradise, as we read in
the second and third chapters of Genesis; or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
<i>allegorically</i>, of some other prohibition, expressed
agreeably to the oriental genius, in
these terms. This diversity of interpretation
makes no difference in the case: whatever the
test of man’s disobedience was, the will of the
law-giver is clearly announced: If thou art
guilty of disobedience, <i>thou shalt surely die</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>Obedience, then, had the promise of <i>continued</i>
life; the penalty threatened to disobedience,
was <i>death</i>: which was only saying,
that the gift freely bestowed on a certain
condition (and surely what man had no right
to demand, might be offered on what terms
the giver pleased) should be withdrawn on the
breach of it. The loss, indeed, was immense;
but to the loser no wrong was done: and of him
who recalled the free gift, conditionally bestowed,
and justly forfeited, no complaint, in
reason, can be made.</p>

<p>But to what purpose, some will ask, to give
that with one hand, which was presently to be
withdrawn by the other? for the best reason,
no doubt, whether conceivable by us, or not.
However, the sad event was certainly foreseen:
and, what is more, such provision was made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
against it, as to infinite wisdom and goodness
seemed meet.</p>

<p>By contemplating the gradual steps of Providence,
as we are able to trace them in the
revelation itself, we understand, that it was in
the eternal purpose of the divine Governor to
restore life to fallen and mortal man, as <i>freely</i>
as it had been at first bestowed, and on <i>terms</i>
still more advantageous him. But <i>the ways
of heaven are not as our ways</i>, nor to be regulated
by our impatient wishes, or expectations.
What man, in a moment, had wantonly thrown
away, he was to recover once more; but in
God’s good time; not instantly, but after a
long succession of ages, and such a state of
intermediate discipline and preparation, as
might best serve to introduce the intended
blessing with effect.</p>

<p>Man, then was to be reinstated in his forfeited
inheritance: and the <i>promise</i> was made,
though purposely in obscure terms, from the
moment the forfeiture was incurred. In process
of time, it was less, and still less obscurely
signified; yet so as that the full discovery of
what was intended, and, still more, the execution
of it, was long deferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>At length, Jesus Christ came into the world
to fulfill and to declare the whole will of God
on this interesting subject: and from him, and
from those commissioned by him, we learn
what the wisest men, and even <i>angels</i>, <i>had desired
to look into</i>, and could at most discern
but imperfectly through the types and shadows
of the patriarchal and Mosaic dispensations.</p>

<p>The great mystery, now unveiled, was
briefly this: that God of his infinite goodness
had, indeed, from the foundation of the world,
purposed the restoration of eternal life to his
unworthy creature, man; but that in his wisdom
he saw fit to confer this unmerited blessing
in a way, that should at once secure the
honour of his government; and, if any thing
could secure it, the future obedience and happiness
of his creature: that he would only confer
this mighty privilege at the instance, as it
were, and for the sake of a transcendantly divine
person, his only begotten Son, the second
person in the glorious Trinity, as we now style
him: that this divine person; of his own free
will co-operating with the <i>eternal purpose</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of
the all-gracious Father, should descend from
Heaven; should become incarnate; should as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
man, converge with men, and instruct them by
his heavenly doctrine; should taste deeply of
all their sorrows and infirmities (<i>sin only excepted</i>);
should even pour out his blood unto
death, and by that blood should wash away
the stain of guilt; and, on the condition of
<i>faith</i> in his name, operating, as of course it
must do, by a sincere obedience to his authority,
should admit us, once more, to the possession
of eternal happiness; of which, finally,
we have a <i>lively</i> and certain hope, in that he
who had laid down his life, had power to take
it again, as was declared to all the world by
his resurrection from the dead<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>In this awfully stupendous manner (at which
reason stands aghast, and faith herself is half
confounded) was the Grace of God to man, at
length, manifested: and thus it is, when we
come a little to unfold the <i>record</i>, or testimony
of the Gospel, that <i>God hath given to as eternal
life</i>; and that <i>this life is in his Son</i>.</p>

<p>Curious men have perplexed themselves and
others by inquiring into the nature of this
astonishing scheme, and have seemed half inclined
not to accept so <i>great salvation</i>, till
they could reconcile it to their ideas of philosophy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
Hence those endless altercations concerning
<i>merit, satisfaction, imputed sin, and
vicarious punishment</i>; in which it is hard to
say, whether more subtlety has been shewn, or
more perverseness; more ingenuity, or presumption.
If most of these questions were
well examined, it would appear, perhaps, that
they are mere verbal disputes, and as frivolous
as they are contentious. But, be the difference
between the parties nominal or real, this
we are sure of, without taking part in the controversy,
that the scriptures speak of the <i>death</i>
of Christ, as a <i>ransom for many</i><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; <i>the price
of our redemption</i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; <i>a sacrifice for us</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; <i>a
propitiation for the sins of the whole world</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>:
that they speak of Christ himself, <i>as dying for
us</i><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, <i>as bearing our sins in his own body on
the tree</i><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; as <i>suffering for sins, the just for
the unjust</i><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>; as <i>tasting death for every man</i><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>;
<i>as giving himself for us, an offering and sacrifice
to God</i><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>; as <i>justifying us by his blood</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>;
and <i>redeeming us by the price of it</i><a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>: with a
multitude of other passages to the same purpose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Now let men use what art they will in
torturing such expressions as these; they will
hardly prevent our seeing what the plain doctrine
of scripture is, “That it pleased God to
give us eternal life only <i>in his Son</i>; and in his
Son <i>only</i> as suffering and dying for us.”</p>

<p>But in this consideration the whole mystery
consists; how to be fully cleared up
to our reason, men may dispute if they will,
and they will dispute the rather, because
the subject is out of their sphere, and beyond
their comprehension. Whether God <i>could</i>
accept such a sacrifice for sin as the death of
his own Son, many have presumptuously asked.
Whether he <i>could not</i> have given life to man,
in another way, some have more modestly
doubted: but the issue of all this arrogant or
needless curiosity, is but the discovery of their
own weakness, on the one hand, and the confession
of this stupendous truth, on the other;
That God did not see fit to bestow eternal salvation
on mankind, but in his own appointed
way, through Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>In this momentous truth, then, enough for
us to know, let us humbly acquiesce, and leave
to others the vanity of disputing the grounds
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>But, though the reasons of this dispensation
be inscrutable to us, the measure of its <i>influence</i>,
some think, they have the means to
discover. For it seems to follow from St.
Paul’s assertion, that, <i>as in Adam all died, so
in Christ shall all be made alive</i><a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; and from
the idea given us of the Redeemer, as of <i>the
lamb slain from the foundation of the world</i><a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>;
that the benefits of Christ’s death extend to all
men, of all times, and are, in the proper sense
of the word, <i>universal</i>. Only it is to be remembered,
that, if all men have an interest in
Christ, whether they know it or not, <i>we</i> who
do know what our interest in him is, have infinitely
the advantage of them, and are inexcusable,
if we reject it.</p>

<p>Thus far then we go upon safe grounds, and
affirm without hesitation, that <i>God</i>, through
his mercies in Christ Jesus, <i>is the Saviour of
all men</i>, but <i>especially of them that believe</i><a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>Another consideration, and of the utmost
moment, is yet behind. Though eternal life
be now again bestowed on mankind, this gift
is not one and the same thing to all, but is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
differently modified according to the different
conduct of those to whom it is given. All shall
<i>live</i>; but whether to happiness, or misery,
and to what degree of <i>either</i>, will depend on
the use of those advantages, whether of nature
or grace, which every one enjoys. Not, that
any degree of eternal happiness is, or can be
strictly due to any man, but that the several
degrees of it will be <i>proportioned</i> to our respective
moral and religious qualifications. To
have done otherwise, would have been to confound
the order of things, and to appoint a
scheme of salvation, which must utterly extinguish
all virtuous industry among men. Hence,
we are told, that the righteous shall shine out
in different degrees of happiness, <i>as one star
differeth from another star in glory</i><a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p>In like manner, they who shall be found
worthy, not of happiness, but misery, will be
sentenced to several allotments of it, by the
same equal rule.</p>

<p>It may seem, perhaps, that, as our best
works could not <i>merit</i> eternal life in happiness,
so our worst cannot <i>deserve</i> eternal life in
misery. But let us take care how we push our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
inquiries into this aweful subject. In rewarding
obedience, the <i>divine goodness</i> is chiefly
displayed; and who shall presume to set bounds
to it? But, in punishing disobedience, the
<i>divine Wisdom</i>, of which we conceive much
more imperfectly, is mainly concerned: and
what examples of severity in the punishment
of incorrigibly impenitent offenders, after such
means as have been devised to reclaim them,
and for the support of his moral government
over more worlds than we have any idea of, this
attribute may demand, we shall do well, with all
submission and modesty, to leave unexplored.</p>

<p>Still, what is just, that is, what is right and
fit, on the whole, undoubtedly take place:
but we <i>are</i> not, we <i>cannot</i>, be competent
judges of what is fit and right in this instance.
It will be safest to rely, without further inquiry,
on the general declaration of him, who
was not only our Redeemer, but shall one day
be our merciful judge: <i>These</i>, says he, [that is,
the wicked] <i>shall go away into everlasting punishment:
but the righteous into life eternal</i><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p>What remains on this subject, is only to admonish
you of those <i>relations</i>, in which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
stand towards the Author of our salvation, and
the correspondent <i>duties</i> they impose upon us.
I can but just point out these <i>relations</i> and
<i>duties</i>: though they deserve to be inculcated
(as, in fact, they have been, by the sacred
writers) with all the force of eloquent persuasion,
that words can give.</p>

<p>With regard, to the supreme cause of all
things, who is of himself only the source, and
principle of deity, and the original author of
our salvation, God, thus understood, is graciously
pleased to present himself to us in the
Gospel, under the idea of <span class="smcap">the Father</span>, and to
consider us in the tender relation of <i>sons</i>. We
owe him, therefore, all possible filial love and
reverence, and must so conceive of his part in
the mystery of our redemption, as to refer all
the fruits of it, ultimately, <i>to the glory of God
the Father</i><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>In subordination to the <i>Father</i>, <small>HE</small> in whom
we have eternal life, is our <i>friend</i><a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, and therefore
entitled to our warmest love: he is our
greatest <i>benefactor</i><a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, and therefore claims our
utmost gratitude: he is our only <i>master</i><a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, and
of course, must be followed with all observance:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
he is our <i>redeemer</i>, and <i>sole mediator between
God and man</i><a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>; therefore he challenges an
implicit, an exclusive trust and confidence
from us: he is the appointed <i>judge</i> of the
world<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>; therefore to be regarded with the
humblest fear and veneration: lastly, he is <i>the
only begotten Son of God</i><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, nay <i>our Lord and
our God</i><a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>; to whom therefore we are to pay
transcendant honour, so as <i>to honour, the Son
even as we honour the Father</i><a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<p>These are some, the chief of those duties,
which, as Christians, we are bound to perform
towards the Author of our salvation. The <i>relations</i>
from which they spring, could not be
discovered by the light of nature; but, when
made known to us by revelation, they require
as certainly, and as reasonably, the several
<i>duties</i> which correspond to them, as the <i>relations</i>
in which we stand to God and man, as
discoverable by nature only, require their
respective <i>duties</i>.</p>

<p>You see, then, the sphere of a Christian’s
duty is much enlarged beyond that of the natural
man: and not in these instances only, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
the gospel has made known another divine
<i>person</i>, (so we are obliged to speak) <i>the holy
Spirit of God</i>, who stands in a distinct relation
to us; and to whom, therefore, his proper and
peculiar honour is due. But of this divine
person in the glorious Trinity, I shall find
another occasion to lay before you, at large,
what the scriptures have brought to light.</p>

<p>For the present, it may suffice to have put
you in mind of what we are taught concerning
<i>the grace of God in his Son Jesus Christ</i>; to
the end that, religiously observing all the duties
which this revealed doctrine requires of us,
we may fully correspond to the gracious intentions
of the revealer, by having <i>our fruit unto
holiness</i>; and <i>the end, everlasting life. For
the wages of sin</i> (be it ever remembered) <i>is
death: but eternal life is the gift of God
through Jesus Christ our Lord<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>: To whom
be all praise, thanksgiving, and honour, now
and for evermore. Amen.</i></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gal.</span> vi. 8.</h3>

<p><i>He that soweth to the spirit, shall</i> <small>OF THE
SPIRIT REAP LIFE EVERLASTING</small>.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Without</span> staying to point out the immediate
occasion of these words, or to enumerate
and define the several senses of the word
<i>spirit</i>, in sacred scripture, it is sufficient to
my present purpose to observe, that the text
affirms <i>a general and fundamental truth of
the Gospel</i>, more clearly and particularly explained
elsewhere. It is this: That he who
in this life conducts himself according to the
rules and admonitions of God’s holy spirit,
which the Apostle calls, <i>sowing to the spirit</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
shall, through the influence of the same spirit,
obtain, that is, in the Apostle’s figurative style,
<i>shall reap, life everlasting</i>.</p>

<p>But, what! you will say, everlasting life
is the <i>gift of God through Christ</i>: how is it
then that we receive this gift at the hands of
another, of <i>God’s holy spirit</i>?</p>

<p>To resolve this difficulty, and to open to you
at the same time the Christian doctrine of grace,
together with the concern which we have in it,
I shall consider,</p>

<p>I. In what <i>sense</i> we are to understand the
assertion, <i>That everlasting life is of the spirit</i>.</p>

<p>II. In what <i>way</i> this blessing is conferred
upon us; under which head I shall have occasion
to set forth the several <i>offices and operations</i>
of the holy Spirit.</p>

<p>III. Lastly, what <i>returns of duty</i>, as corresponding
to these <i>offices</i> of the Spirit, and as
resulting from the <i>relations</i> in which we stand
towards him, are, in consequence of this revelation,
reasonably required of us.</p>

<p>I. To understand in what <i>sense</i> the scriptures
assert <i>everlasting life to be of the spirit</i>, it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
be necessary to form to ourselves a distinct idea
of the divine œconomy in the whole work of our
redemption; which (to sum up briefly what is
revealed to us) appears to have been conducted
in the following manner.</p>

<p>God the Father of his mere grace, purposed
and <i>willed</i><a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, from all eternity, the restoration of
<i>life</i> to man, after his forfeiture of it by disobedience:
but he saw fit to make our <i>title</i> to
this free gift depend on the death and sacrifice of
his son Jesus Christ: and, lastly, to give the
<i>actual possession</i> of it only through the ministration
of his holy Spirit.</p>

<p>The whole of this process is full of wonder;
but there is no contradiction, or inconsistency
in its several parts.</p>

<p>However, to open the œconomy of this dispensation
a little more distinctly, it is to be
observed, that eternal life may be taken in two
senses. It may either imply <i>a mere state of</i>
<small>ENDLESS EXISTENCE</small>; and, in this sense, it is
solely and properly the gift of God through
Christ; <i>for as in Adam all died, even so in
Christ shall all be made alive</i><a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>: Or, it may
mean, what it always does mean in those passages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
of scripture, where it is magnified so much,
<i>a state of</i> <small>HAPPINESS</small>, in that existence; and
then only a capacity of being put into this state
is procured for us by the Redeemer. But this
capacity, this <i>grace of God</i>, may be <i>frustrated
by us</i><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, may even turn against is, if we be
not duly prepared to enjoy that <i>happiness</i> of
which we are made capable; and such <i>preparation</i>,
is the proper distinctive work of God’s
holy spirit.</p>

<p>Further, to see the necessity, the importance
at least, of such preparation, we are to reflect,
that, by the fall of man, not only life was forfeited,
but the powers of his mind were weakened.
Transgression had clouded his understanding,
and perverted his will. He neither
saw his duty so clearly as before, nor was disposed
to perform it so vigorously. And this
depravation of his faculties, we easily conceive,
<i>might</i>, as an original taint, be transmitted to
his posterity; nay, we certainly feel that it <i>is</i> so:
yet, without any imputation on the author of
our being, who might have placed us in this
disadvantageous state, if he had pleased, from
the beginning; and to whom we are accountable
for the right use of the advantages we have,
not of those we have not. Still, the purity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
God’s nature might require what his wisdom
has decreed, that <i>without holiness no man shall
see the Lord</i><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, and that Jesus should be <i>the
author of eternal salvation to those</i> only, who,
in a higher degree than our fallen nature of
itself permits, <i>obey him</i><a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. And this change in
our moral condition from bad to good, from a
propensity to evil to a love of righteousness, is
called in scripture, <i>a renewing of our minds</i>,
<i>a new creation</i>, <i>a new man</i>; in opposition to the
former so different state of our minds, which is
called <i>the old man corrupted according to the
deceitful lusts</i><a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p>For the <i>change</i> itself, it is represented in
scripture as proceeding, not from the virtue of
our own minds, but from the influence of the
Holy Ghost upon them<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>: and when it has taken
place in us, then, and not till then, is <i>our
election sure</i>, and we are <i>made heirs according
to the hope of eternal life</i><a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>This extraordinary provision for restoring
man to the image of God, to <i>the new man,
which after God is created in righteousness
and true holiness</i><a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, is what reason could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
have hoped for, but, when made known by revelation,
seems to have been expedient, may be
conceived to have been even necessary, and is
clearly an expression of the divine goodness,
which, though it fill our minds very justly with
wonder, well as gratitude, none of our natural
notions contradict.</p>

<p>We see, then, in general, <i>how</i> the new man
receives the gift of eternal life from the spirit.
Let us now consider more particularly,</p>

<p>II. In the second place, in what <i>way</i> this new
creation is carried on and perfected in us.
And here we shall find all the marks of that
wisdom and fitness, which are discernable in the
thing itself.</p>

<p><i>For</i> we are <i>renewed in the spirit of our
minds</i><a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, <i>by the teaching of the spirit of truth</i><a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>,
<i>through sanctification of the spirit</i><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, and
<i>comfort of the Holy Ghost</i><a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>: that is, we have
a new and better turn given to our minds, by
the light derived into them from the spirit; by
the good thoughts and purposes which he excites
in them; and by the joy and consolation
with which he rewards our endeavours to profit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
by the assistance thus graciously afforded
to us.</p>

<p>That we very much want these helps and
encouragements, we <i>all</i> know: that we are
very much indebted to them, we <i>Christians</i>
believe: and that they are not the less real,
because, perhaps, not distinguishable from the
workings of our own minds, now that revelation
assures us of the fact, we have no scruple to
affirm.</p>

<p>To this divine Spirit, then, <i>the spirit of the
Father</i><a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, and <i>the spirit of the Son</i><a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, as he is
equally styled, because proceeding from both;
to this spirit, I say, <i>enlightening</i> our understandings,
<i>purifying</i> our wills, and <i>confirming</i>
our faith, we must impute all that is good in us,
all that proficiency in <i>true holiness</i> which
qualifies us for the enjoyment of heaven: and
through this discipline it is, that they <i>who
sow to the spirit</i>, are, in the end, enabled <i>of
the spirit to reap everlasting life</i>.</p>

<p>These <i>three</i> characters might be further
opened and distinctly considered; and then
it would appear, that all the revelations of
God’s will, chiefly with regard to the redemption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
of man, made to the patriarchs of old, to
the prophets under the law, to the Apostles of
our Lord, nay to our Lord himself, as <i>the
man Christ Jesus</i>, and all the secret illuminations
of the faithful in all times, are to be regarded
as so many emanations from the spirit
of God, <small>THE ENLIGHTENER</small>: that at the gradual
improvements of our virtue, all the graces
which first descend upon our hearts, and then
manifest themselves in every good word and
work, are the production of the same spirit, in
his office of <small>SANCTIFIER</small>: and, lastly, that all
the firmness and resolution we possess under
every trial in this world, all the foretaste we
have of future favour and acceptance, all our
joy and peace in believing, are the signs and
proofs of the <small>COMFORTER</small>, speaking to us, and,
according to our Saviour’s promise, <i>abiding
in us</i>.</p>

<p>It is very conceivable that all this diversity
of operations may be justly and reasonably ascribed
to the influence of the holy Spirit, without
supposing that our own freedom is impeded
or infringed. For influence is not compulsion;
and we are every day induced by others to do
that which we should not have done of ourselves,
without feeling or suspecting that the
least violence is offered to our free-will. <i>A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
convincing truth</i> clearly presented to us; <i>a
virtuous thought</i> incidentally suggested; <i>a
gleam of hope or gladness</i>, suddenly let in
upon us; all this is no more than we frequently
experience in the company of wise and good
men, who yet would be much surprised, and
would have reason to think themselves much
injured, if we complained of any undue influence
exerted by them. Yet thus it is, and
thus only, that the holy spirit <i>constraineth us</i>:
and the scriptures are so far from representing
this constraint under the idea of force, or physical
necessity, that they speak of it as the perfection
of moral freedom: <i>Where the spirit of
the Lord is</i>, says the Apostle, <i>there is liberty</i><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

<p>Having, therefore, seen in <i>what sense</i> it is
affirmed that the spirit <i>giveth</i> life; and in <i>what
way</i>, consistently with the free use of our faculties,
he dispenses this gift, and exercises a
variety of offices towards us; it remains,</p>

<p>III. In the last place, to see what <i>returns
of duty</i>, as corresponding to the several characters
of the holy Spirit, and resulting from
the relations in which we stand to him, are required
on our part; in other words, what we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
are to do, before we can hope to be <i>transformed
by the renewing of our minds</i>, under the influence
of the holy Spirit.</p>

<p>One previous indispensable condition of our
obtaining that influence seems to be, that we
<small>ASK</small> <i>it</i>, that is, put up our petitions to God for
it: a consideration, which, while it shews the
utility, the necessity of prayer, sufficiently accounts,
I doubt, to many of us, for the little
or no effect which, as we pretend and sometimes
lament, this renovating power of the
spirit has upon us.</p>

<p>This duty of prayer being supposed; with
regard to the holy spirit himself, <i>in general</i>,
all the reverence, honour, worship, which his
divine nature exacts from us, and all the love
and gratitude which his gracious concurrence
with the Father and the Son, in the great
work of our redemption, so eminently deserves,
are to be religiously paid to him.</p>

<p>More <i>particularly</i>, we are to consider, that
to the several characters or offices, sustained by
this divine person, and exercised towards us,
several duties respectively correspond; which
indeed are obvious enough, but must just be
pointed out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>1. If a ray of light break in upon us, if a
new degree of knowledge be imparted to us,
if we see the truth of the gospel more clearly
in any respect than before we had done, we
cannot mistake in ascribing this additional information
or conviction (which comes very frequently
we know not how, and when the general
bent of our thoughts, perhaps, lies another
way) to the illuminating spirit within us; and
we are to see to what further purpose that illumination
may serve, and how far it may go towards
dissipating the darkness of our minds in
other instances.</p>

<p>2. If we feel (as at times we all of us do) a
vicious inclination checked, a virtuous purpose
encouraged, a moral or a pious sentiment suggested,
these secret motions are, nay, must be,
from the holy Spirit; and our duty is to entertain
and to improve them.</p>

<p>3. Or, again, if we perceive our devotions
to be quickened, our hopes enlivened, our
faith fortified, though the present state of our
temper or constitution may be instrumental in
producing these effects, yet, if they go no father
than scripture warrants, and right reason
allows, we shall not mistake (having the express
promise of our Lord and Master) in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
ascribing these consolations of peace and joy
to the <i>Comforter</i>; we may regard them as <i>the
earnest and pledge of the spirit in our hearts</i><a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>:
and then, our part is so to cherish and use
them, as to <i>go on from strength to strength</i><a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>,
till we arrive at perfection.</p>

<p>You see there is enough for us to do, though
<i>the spirit strive with our spirit</i><a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>, and in such
sort that we derive the power <i>to will and to do</i><a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
what we ought, ultimately from him.</p>

<p>I know that this, and other things, which
on the authority of scripture, I have delivered
on the present subject, will appear strange to
natural reason. But so that scripture has prepared
us to expect they would do. <i>For the
natural man</i>, says the Apostle, <i>receiveth not
the things of the spirit of God: for they are
foolishness unto him</i><a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. And to the same purpose
our divine Master himself, speaking <i>of
the spirit of truth; whom</i>, says he, <i>the world
cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither
knoweth him: but ye</i>, addressing himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
to his disciples [that is, to men, who walk by
<i>faith</i>, and not by sight] <i>ye know him, for he
dwelleth with you, and shall be in you</i>.</p>

<p>On this assurance, then, we may reasonably
believe what, by reason, we cannot understand.
And the substance of what we are to believe
on this whole subject, is contained in a single
text of St. Peter, where the <i>three</i> divine persons,
yet ineffably <i>one</i> God, “<i>the Trinity in
unity</i><a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>,” whom we adore, and their respective
offices, are accurately distinguished. For
in the opening of his first epistle, he pronounces

<p><i>Having therefore these promises (dearly beloved)
let us cleanse ourselves from all
filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Our</span> discourses from this place turning very
much, as they ought to do, on the great
Christian doctrine of salvation, that is, of
<i>eternal life</i>, considered as the gift of God to
mortal and sinful man, through the redemption
of his Son, and the sanctification of his
holy Spirit, it would be a strange neglect in us,
if we did not take care to remind our hearers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
of the effect which that doctrine ought to have
upon them.</p>

<p>This duty I mean now to discharge towards
you: and I cannot do it more properly than
by enforcing that advice which St. Paul gave
the Corinthians, as the result of a long and
eloquent discourse to them on the same subject.
<i>Having</i> <small>THEREFORE</small> (says he) these promises
[i. e. the promise of <i>eternal life</i>, and of
<i>acceptance through Christ</i>, so as to become
<i>the people of God</i>, nay <i>the sons of God</i>, with
other assurances of the like sort<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>, interspersed
in the two preceding chapters, <i>Having these
promises</i>] <i>let us cleanse ourselves from all
filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness
in the fear of God</i>.</p>

<p>The inference, you see, is direct to our purpose:
and common ingenuity, if nothing else,
might well engage us, in return for such great
and precious promises, to draw the same conclusion
for ourselves. But, when we further
consider that these promises are conditional,
and made only to those who obey the giver
of them<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, interest, as well as gratitude, will
oblige us to yield that obedience so expressly
required of us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>This obedience is briefly summed up in the
direction; <i>to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness
of flesh and spirit</i>, that is, to take care,
agreeably to the double obligation imposed
upon us by the distinct parts of our constitution,
that we consult the integrity both of our
bodies and minds; and preserve them both
from that defilement which each of them, according
to its nature, is liable to contract in
this state of moral probation.</p>

<p>I. With regard to the <small>FLESH</small>, the gross vices
which defile that part of our frame, are so expressly
condemned by the law of reason, as
well as of the gospel, and are so repugnant to
the inbred modesty of every man, especially,
a such as have had their natural sense of
decency quickened by a good education, that
but to mention them in this place, I would
hope, is quite sufficient. If I go farther, it
shall only be to remind you of one thing,
which I have explained at large on a former
occasion<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>, That Christianity hath added unspeakably
to the worth and dignity of the
human body, by considering it no longer as
the store-house of impure lusts, but as the
habitation, the <i>temple</i> of the living God, to
whose sole use it is now dedicated<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>The turpitude, the dishonour, the impiety
of desecrating this sanctuary of the holy Spirit
by sordid, carnal excesses, is then apparent to
every Christian.</p>

<p>But the vices of the <small>SPIRIT</small> do not always
strike the attention so forcibly; though they
be as real as those of the body, and sometimes
more fatal. The reason is, that the spiritual
part of man does not lie so open to observation
as the corporeal. The mind is not easily made
an object to itself; and, when it is, we have a
strange power of seeing it in a false light, and
of overlooking its blemishes, or of even mistaking
them for beauties. In short, <i>the filthiness
of the spirit</i> may be long unobserved,
and therefore <i>uncleansed</i>, if it be not pointed
out to us by some friendly monitor, who is
more practised in this mental inspection than
ourselves, or has less interest, however, to conceal
our depravity from us.</p>

<p>Permit me, then, to assume the charitable
office of holding up to your view these <i>spiritual
vices</i>; not all of every sort (for that
would be endless) but the chief of those which
tend more immediately to defeat the gracious
<i>promises</i> made to us in the gospel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>II. I say nothing of that corruption which
direct and positive infidelity strikes through
the soul, whether it be the infidelity of
Atheism, or what is called Deism; because,
on men who espouse either of these systems,
the promises of the gospel take no hold; and
because it ought not, cannot be supposed, that
men of no religion, or of no faith, appear in
these Christian assemblies. You will think me
better employed in pointing out such corruptions,
as may not improbably adhere even
to believers; though concealed from their own
observation, it may be, or disguised, at least,
to themselves, under various pretences.</p>

<p>1. The first of these that I shall mention is
a sort of <small>HALF-BELIEF</small>, which floats in the
mind, and, though it do not altogether renounce
the hopes of the Gospel, is far from
reposing a firm trust in them. Many professed
believers have, I doubt, this infirmity,
this taint of infidelity, still cleaving to them.
They think Christianity an useful institution;
nay, they think it not destitute of all divine
authority. But then they reduce this authority
to just nothing, by allowing themselves to put
it as low as they can—by taking great liberties
in explaining both its doctrines and precepts—by
admitting such parts of this revelation, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
they believe themselves able to make out to
the satisfaction of their own minds, and by
rejecting, at least by questioning in some sort,
whatever they cannot perfectly understand—by
treating some things as incredible, others,
as impracticable; one part of their religion as
too mysterious, and another as too severe.
“They believe, they say, what they can: but,
after all, there are many strange things in
this religion; and the evidence for the truth
of them is not so controuling, but that there
is room for some degree of doubt and
hesitation.”</p>

<p>All this, perhaps, they do not say to others;
nay, not to themselves, except when they are
pressed by some conclusion from scripture,
which either their prejudices, or their passions,
make them very unwilling to admit; and then
they take leave to be as sceptical as the occasion
requires.</p>

<p>But now from such a faith as this, no
wholesome or permanent fruits can be expected.
It has no root in them; and the
<i>promises</i>, that should feed and nourish it,
have but a faint and feeble effect; just enough,
perhaps, to keep their hopes from dying outright,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
but much too little to push them into
any vigorous efforts of obedience.</p>

<p>The way for such to <i>cleanse themselves</i> from
this pollution of spirit (for to the several defects,
the proper remedy in each case shall, as
we go along, be subjoined) is, once for all, to
examine the foundations of their religion; and,
if they find them, on the whole, solid and satisfactory,
to rely upon them thenceforth with
a confidence entire and unshaken. They should
reflect, that every revealed doctrine, of whatever
sort, as standing on the same ground of
infallible truth, is equally to be admitted.
There is no compromising matters with their
divine Master: they must either quit his service,
or follow him without reserve. And this,
upon the whole, they will find to be the manly
and the reasonable part for them to take. To
halt between two opinions so repugnant to
each other, to embrace so interesting a thing
as religion by halves, is neither for the credit
of their courage, nor of their understanding.</p>

<p>Having then the <i>promise</i> of eternal life, let
them reckon upon that promise, like men who
know its value, and do not mistrust on what
ground it stands. If they are Christians at all,
they cannot justify it even to themselves not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
be Christians in good earnest. And thus will
they happily escape the disgrace of an <i>irresolved
and indolent faith</i>; which involves
them in much of the guilt, and in almost all
the mischiefs, of infidelity. But,</p>

<p>2. There are those who have not a doubt
about the truth of Christianity, and yet,
through a certain <small>LEVITY OF MIND</small>, derive but
little benefit from their conviction.</p>

<p>This spiritual vice is, perhaps, the commonest
of all others; and, though it seems to
have something prodigious in it, is easily accounted
for from the intoxication of health,
youth, and high spirits; from the restless pursuit
of pleasure, which occupies one part of
the world, and of business, which distracts
another; from a too passionate love of society
in many; from feverish habits of dissipation in
more; and from a fatal impatience of solitude
and recollection in almost all.</p>

<p>But, by whichsoever of these causes the vice
of inconsideration, we have now before us, is
produced and nourished, it is of the most
malignant sort, and being ready to branch out
into many others, should be resolutely checked
and suppressed. Though there be nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
directly criminal in the pursuit which takes us
from ourselves, it is always dangerous to lose
sight of what we are, and whither we are
going, and may be fatal. For, not to believe,
and not to call to mind what we believe, is
nearly the same thing. And when a temptation
meets us thus unprepared, it wants no
assistance from infidelity, but is secure of
prevailing by its own strength, under cover of
our inattention.</p>

<p>Such, I doubt not, is the sad experience
of thousands, every day; while yet the misjudging
world, that part of it, especially,
whose interest it is to suppose that all men
are equally destitute of religious principles,
rashly conclude that there is no faith, where
there is so much folly. “These hypocrites,
say they, are convicted of the same unbelief,
which they perpetually object to us:” Alas,
no: they are convicted of inconsequence,
only.</p>

<p>Not that this consideration excuses their
guilt: it even aggravates and inflames it. For,
when <i>one thing</i>, only, <i>is needful</i>, and they
know it to be so, not to retain a practical, an
habitual sense of it, but to suffer every trifle
to mislead, every sudden gust of passion to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
drive them from <i>the hope</i> and end <i>of their
calling</i>, argues an extreme depravity of mind,
and deserves a harsher name than we commonly
give to this conduct.</p>

<p>However, soften it to ourselves, as we will,
under any fashionable denomination, the <i>spirit</i>
must be cured of this vice, or the <i>promises</i> of
the Gospel are lost upon us. And the proper
remedy is but one. We must resolve, at all
events, to acquire the contrary habit of consideration.
We must meditate much and often
on what we believe: we must force our minds
to dwell upon it: we must converse more with
ourselves, how bad company soever we take
that to be, and less with the world, which so
easily dissipates our thoughts, and oversets our
best resolutions.</p>

<p>If we would but every day set apart a small
portion of our time, were it but a few minutes,
to supplicate the grace of God, and to say seriously
to ourselves; <i>I believe the promises,
and I acknowledge the authority of the
gospel</i>; (and less than this, who can think
excusable in any man, whatever his condition
of life may be, that calls himself a Christian?)
this short and easy discipline, regularly pursued,
and, on no pretence whatever, intermitted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
would presently effect the cure we so much
want, and restore the sickly mind to its health
and vigour.</p>

<p>3. Still, there may be a general belief in the
promises of the Gospel, and a good degree of
attention to them, and yet men may be but
little impressed by what they thus believe and
consider. This affection of the mind is sometimes
experienced, but has hardly acquired a
distinct name. Let us call it, if you please, a
<small>DEADNESS</small>, or <small>INSENSIBILITY OF HEART</small>; which,
so far as it proceeds from natural constitution,
is a misfortune only; but, when cherished or
even neglected by us, it becomes a fault.</p>

<p>The danger of it lies here, lest by seeing
with indifference the most important objects
of our hopes and fears, we come by degrees to
neglect or overlook them; to question, perhaps,
the reality of them; or, to lose, however, the
benefit which even a calm view of these objects,
when frequently set before the mind,
must needs convey to us.</p>

<p>The rule in this case plainly is, To prescribe
to ourselves such a regimen as is proper to
correct this spiritual lethargy: that is, to stimulate
the sluggish mind by the most poignant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
reflexions; to bring the objects of our faith as
near and close to us as we can; to paint them
in the liveliest colours of the imagination,
which, when touched itself, easily sets fire to
the affections; and, above all, to keep our eye
intently and steadily upon them.</p>

<p>We may see the utility of this regimen, in a
case which is familiar to every body.</p>

<p>When we look forward to the end of life, it
appears at a vast distance. The many, or the
few years, that lie before us, take up a great
deal of room in the mind, and present the idea
of a long, and almost interminable duration.
Hence the fatal security in which we most of
us live, as conceiving that, when so much time
is on our hands, we need not be sollicitous to
make the most of it.</p>

<p>But that all this is a mere delusion, we may
see by looking back on the time that is already
elapsed. We have lived in this world, twenty,
forty, it may be, many more years: yet, in
reflecting on this space, we find it just nothing:
the several parts of it run together in
the mind, and the first moment of our existence
seems almost to touch upon the present.
Now, by anticipating this experience, and applying
it to the remaining period of our lives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
we may satisfy ourselves, that the years to
come will pass away as rapidly, and, when
gone, will appear as inconsiderable as the past;
and the effect of this anticipation must be, to
convince us, that no part of this brief term is
to be trifled with, or unimproved.</p>

<p>Then, again, we have the power of imaging
to ourselves, in a very lively manner, the circumstances
in which death surprises very
many thoughtless persons every day; and what
we should feel in their situation.</p>

<p>Lay then these two things together; make
<i>the shortness of life</i>, and <i>the terrors of an
unprepared death</i>, the frequent object of your
meditation; and see if the most callous mind
will not presently be much affected by them.</p>

<p>4. The fourth and last vice of the spirit,
which I have time to mention to you, is
rather, perhaps, to be accounted a complication
of vices. But what I mean is that unhappy
turn of mind which prompts many persons to
elude the effects of faith, reflexion, and even
a lively sense, in matters of religion, by certain
tricks of <small>SOPHISTRY</small>, which they practise on
themselves. They believe, and they would
gladly obtain, the promises of the gospel, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
repentance, they suppose, will supply the
place of uniform obedience: they will repent,
but not yet; there is time enough, and fitter
for that purpose, when passion cools, and the
heat of life is over: or, they fancy to themselves
an inexhaustible fund of goodness in
their religion; the terms of it may not be rigidly
insisted upon; the promises may not be
so conditional as they seem to be; and the
threats, without doubt, will not be punctually
executed. At the worst, there is no need to
despair of mercy, considering the frailty of
man, and the infinite merits of the Redeemer.</p>

<p>Such reasonings as these argue a depraved
mind, and tend, further, to deprave it. But
your good sense prevents me in the confutation
of them. I would only observe, that this vice
is, as I said, a complicated one: for, together
with the unfairness and disingenuity (which
belongs to all sophistry, as such) we have here
united (what is too common in religious
sophistry) a great deal of unwarrantable presumption.</p>

<p>The remedy in the case is, To cultivate in
ourselves a modest and ingenuous love of
truth; an awful reverence of the revealed word,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
and that simplicity of heart which excludes all
artifice and refinement.</p>

<p>From these so pernicious vices of the spirit,
then, that is, from a <i>fluctuating faith</i>, an
<i>inconsiderate levity</i>, an <i>inapprehensive deadness
of heart</i>, and a <i>perverse sophistical
abuse of the understanding</i>, let us emancipate
ourselves by a firm, attentive, vigorous, and
ingenuous dependance on the promises of the
gospel; from these defilements, I say, in particular
(having shaken off the other more
sordid corruptions of the <i>flesh and spirit</i>)
let us anxiously <i>cleanse</i> our minds, with the
view of <i>perfecting holiness</i>, as the text admonishes,
<small>IN THE FEAR OF GOD</small>.</p>

<p>This last clause is by no means an insignificant
one; as ye will see by recollecting, that
the true temper of a Christian is, hope mixed
with fear; <i>hope</i>, to animate his courage, and
<i>fear</i>, to quicken his attention. For, unless
this principle of fear, not a servile, but filial
fear, inform the soul and invigorate its functions,
we shall be far from <small>PERFECTING
HOLINESS</small>; we shall at best exhibit in our
lives but some broken, detached, incoherent
parcels of it. A steady, uniform piety,
such as begets that <i>hope, which maketh not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
ashamed</i><a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, is only kept up by a constant
watchfulness and circumspection; which our
probationary state plainly demands, and which
nothing but <i>the fear of God</i> effectually
secures.</p>

world; received up into glory.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> inspired writers, sometimes, dilate on
the articles of the Christian religion; pursue
them separately, and at length, for the fuller
and more distinct information of the faithful.
Sometimes, again, they give them to us, as it
were, in clusters: they accumulate their awful
doctrines and discoveries, to strike and astonish
the mind with their united force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>This <i>last</i> is the method of the text, which I
shall a little open and explain; but so as to
conform myself to the Apostle’s purpose in
giving a brief collective view of Christianity,
that, the whole of it being seen together, we
may be the more sensibly affected by it.</p>

<p>1. This <i>great mystery of godliness</i> opens
with—<span class="smcap">God manifest in the flesh</span>.</p>

<p>When the scheme of man’s redemption was
laid, it was not thought fit that an Apostle,
a prophet, a man like ourselves, no nor an
Angel or Archangel, should be the instrument
of it; but that the <i>word of God</i>, the <i>Son of
God</i>, nay <i>God</i> himself (as he is here and elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
called) should take this momentous
office upon him: that heaven should stoop to
earth, and that the divine nature should condescend
to leave the mansions of glory, inshrine
itself in a fleshly tabernacle, should be <i>made
man</i>, should <i>dwell among us</i>, and <i>die for us</i>.</p>

<p>If you ask, why may not a man, or angel,
have sufficed to execute this purpose of man’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
salvation; or, if only this divine person was
equal to it, why he did not rather assume a
glorified, than our mortal body; why it was
necessary for him to inherit all our infirmities
(sin only excepted,) and yet be conceived, in
so extraordinary a manner of the holy Spirit;
nay, and why he should be so conceived, and
born of a <i>virgin</i> (a miracle of that peculiar sort
as scarce seems capable of proof, and, in fact,
is only proved indirectly by the subsequent life
and character and history of this divine person):
If you ask these, and a hundred other such
questions, I answer readily and frankly, <i>I
know not</i>: But then consider, that <i>my</i> ignorance,
that is, any man’s ignorance, of the
reasons why these things were done, is no argument,
not so much as a presumption against
there being reasons, nay, and the best reasons,
for so mysterious a dispensation. Consider,
too, that these mysteries no way contradict
any clear principle of your own reason: all that
appears is, that you should not have expected,
previously to the revelation of it, such a design
to be formed; and that, now it is revealed,
you do not understand why it was so conducted.
But we are just in the same state of ignorance,
with regard to almost every part of the divine
conduct. This world, so unquestionably the
work of infinite wisdom and goodness, is not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
in numberless respects, what we should expect
it to have been; of many parts we see not the
use and end; in some, there is the appearance
of deformity; in others, of mischief; in
all, when attentively considered, of something
above, or beside, our apprehension.</p>

<p>Such then being the case of the natural world,
why may not the moral have its depths and
difficulties? You see God in the creation:
why not in redemption? In the former, he
condescends, according to our best philosophy,
to manifest himself in the meanest reptile, all
whose instincts he immediately prompts, and
whose movements he directs and governs: why
then might he not manifest himself in man,
though in another manner, and by an union
with him still more close and intimate?</p>

<p>But I pursue these questions no farther. It
is enough that, admitting the fact, on the faith
of the revelation itself, we see a wonderful
goodness and condescension in this whole procedure:
that we understand the importance of
having such a saviour and guide and example of
life, as <i>God manifest in the flesh</i>; that we are
led to conceive, with astonishment, of the
dignity of man, for whose sake the Godhead
assumed our nature, and, at the same time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
with consternation, of the guilt of man, for
the atonement of which this assumption, with
all its consequences, became necessary.</p>

<p><i>God manifest in the flesh</i>, is then the <i>first</i>
chapter of this mysterious book: and yet, as
mysterious as it is, full of the clearest and most
momentous instruction.</p>

<p>2. The <i>second</i> is, that this wonderfully compounded
person was <small>JUSTIFIED IN THE SPIRIT</small>:
that is, <i>by</i>, or <i>through</i> the Spirit: another
mystery, which, however, acquaints us with
this fact, that a third divine person ministered
in the great work of our redemption.</p>

<p>And his ministry was seen in directing the
ancient prophets to foretell the Redeemer’s
coming<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>; in accomplishing his miraculous
conception<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>; in assisting at his baptism<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>; in
conducting him through his temptation<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>; in
giving him the power to cast out devils, which
is expressly said to be <i>by the Spirit of God</i><a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>;
in raising him from the dead, by which event
he was <i>declared the Son of God with power,
according to the spirit of holiness</i><a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>; in descending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
on his disciples on the day of Pentecost<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>;
in bestowing diversities of miraculous gifts<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
upon them, for the confirmation of his doctrine,
and the propagation of it through the world;
and lastly in sanctifying and illuminating the
faithful of all times and places<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.</p>

<p>In all these ways (and if there be any
other) Jesus was <i>justified</i>, that is, his commission
was authenticated by the testimony of the
Holy Spirit. Here, again, many curious
questions may be asked: but what we clearly
learn is, the awful relation we bear to the
Holy Ghost, as co-operating in the scheme of
man’s redemption; and the infinite dignity of
that scheme itself, the execution of which required
the agency of that transcendantly divine
person.</p>

<p>Hitherto the mystery of godliness has been
doubly mysterious, being wrapped up in the
incomprehensible essence of the Deity. It now
stoops, as it were, through this cloud of glory,
and gives itself to be somewhat distinctly apprehended
by us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>3. In the <i>next</i> view we have of the Redeemer,
as being <small>SEEN OF ANGELS</small>.</p>

<p>We have some grounds from analogy to
conclude, that, as there is a scale of beings below
us, there is also one above us: at least,
the conclusion has been pretty generally drawn:
and the belief almost universal of such a scale
ascending from us to God, though the uppermost
round of it still be at an infinite distance
from his throne. But the direct, indeed the
only solid proof of its existence, is the revealed
word, which speaks of <i>Angels</i> and <i>Archangels</i>,
nay <i>myriads</i><a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> of them, disposed into different
ranks, and rising above each other in a wonderful
harmony and proportion.</p>

<p>Such is the idea which scripture gives us of
the invisible world. Now, to raise our minds
to some just apprehension of the great scheme
of our redemption, it represents that world,
as being put in motion by that scheme, as
attentive and <i>earnest to look into it</i><a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>: and,
to exalt our conceptions of the Redeemer
himself, it speaks of that world as being in
subjection to him; of all its inhabitants, the
highest in place and dignity, as serving in his
retinue, and paying homage to his person<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>They accordingly ministered to him in this
capacity, when they celebrated his birth in the
fields of Bethlehem<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>; when they took part with
him in his triumphs over the adversary in the
desart<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>: when they flew to strengthen him in
his last agonies<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>; when they attended, in their
robes of state to grace his resurrection<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>: and
when they ranked themselves, with all observance,
about him, as he went up into
heaven<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Of the angels</i>, then, <i>he was seen</i>, on all these,
and doubtless other, occasions. But how was
he seen? With love and wonder unspeakable,
when they saw their Lord and Master thus
humbling himself for the sake of man; when
they contemplated this bright effulgence of the
Deity, <i>the express image of his person</i><a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>, veiling
all his glories in flesh, and,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">—<i>low-rooft beneath the skies</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>as our great poet sublimely represents his humiliation<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>Still the <i>mystery</i> continues, though it now
submits itself to the scrutiny of our senses; for
it follows,</p>

<p>4. That he was <small>PREACHED TO THE GENTILES</small>.</p>

<p>To enter into the full meaning of this clause,
we are to reflect, That, when the nations of
the earth had so prodigiously corrupted themselves
as to lose the memory of the true religion,
and to give themselves over to the most abominable
impieties, it pleased God to select one
faithful family from the rest of the degenerate
world, and in due time to advance it into a
numerous people; which he vouchsafed to take
into a near relation to himself, and, by a singular
policy, to preserve distinct and separate
from the surrounding tribes of Idolaters.
Henceforth, the Jews (for of that people I
speak) considered themselves as the sole favourites
of Heaven (as they were, indeed, the sole
worshippers of the true God), and all the
heathen as the outcasts of its providence.</p>

<p>This notion, in process of time, became so
rooted in them, that when Jesus now appeared
in Judea, they were ready to engross all his
favours to themselves, and thought it strange
and incredible, that any part of them should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
conferred on the reprobate heathen. So that
he himself was obliged to proceed with much
caution in opening the extent of his commission,
and St. Paul everywhere speaks of the
design to save the Gentiles as the profoundest
mystery, as <i>that which had been kept secret
since the world began</i><a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the mercy of God had
much larger views, and sent the Messiah to be
<i>the saviour of</i> <small>ALL</small> <i>men, especially of them</i>,
out of every nation, <i>that believe</i><a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<p>But this mercy, so <i>mysterious</i> to the Jews,
could not be much less so to the Gentiles, who
must feel how disproportioned the blessing was
to any deserts of man; and who saw how
enormous and how general that corruption was,
which in all likelihood must exclude them from
it. Thus it might reasonably be matter of <i>silent
wonder</i><a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, to both parties, to hear <i>Christ
preached to the Gentiles</i>: only, this <i>latter</i>
(of which party we ourselves are) might say
with a peculiar exultation, what the Jews, even
in <i>glorifying</i> the Author of it, were not, without
some reluctance, brought to acknowledge;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
<i>Then hath God, also, to the Gentiles granted
repentance unto life.</i></p>

<p>And if the surprize be deservedly great to
hear Christ <i>preached to the Gentiles</i>, it must
in all reason grow upon us to find,</p>

<p>5. In the succeeding link of this <i>mysterious</i>
chain, that he was even <small>BELIEVED ON IN THE
WORLD</small>; that is, in the world both of Jews and
Gentiles; in the former, to a certain extent;
and, in the latter, to one which, though not
universal, is truly astonishing.</p>

<p>Of the Jews it is affirmed, that <i>multitudes</i><a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
of them believed: and what especially redounds
to their honour and to our benefit, is, that out
of the Jewish believers were taken those favoured
servants of God, that opened the door
of faith to the Gentiles, and became his instruments
in conveying the light of the Gospel to
all generations. And, considering the inveterate
prejudices of that people, such a measure
of faith, and such effects of it, could not
well have been expected from that quarter.</p>

<p>But then, for the Gentiles, it is astonishing
to observe how quick and how general their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
conversion to the faith was: so that all men
seemed to <i>press</i><a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> into the kingdom of God, and,
as it were, to <i>take it by violence</i><a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. For, within
forty years from the death of Christ, the sound
of the Gospel <i>had gone out into all lands</i><a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>;
and, in less than three centuries from that
event, the empire itself, that is, all the civilized
part of the earth, became Christian: and
this, in spite of every obstruction, which the
lusts of men, operating with all their force,
and confederated together, could throw in the
way of the new religion.</p>

<p><i>So mightily grew the word of God, and
prevailed<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>!</i> and it still prevails: not every where
indeed, nor any where to that degree in which,
we trust, it one day will; but to a certain degree
over a great part of the globe, and especially
in the more enlightened parts of it: an
evident proof, that reason is congenial with
faith; and that nothing but ignorance, corrupted
by vice, can hold out against the cross
of Jesus.</p>

<p>Yet this power of the cross must be thought
prodigious; since its pretensions are so high,
and its doctrine so pure, that, in a world overgrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
with presumption and vice, it could
never have made its way to so much consideration,
if the hand of God had not been with it.</p>

<p>Such is the mystery of Christ <i>believed on in
the world</i>!</p>

<p>But now the Apostle, who had digressed a
little from his main subject, or rather had anticipated
some part of it, returns, from the
effects which Christianity was to have on the
world, to the person of its divine Author; who,
as it follows in the</p>

<p>6. <i>Sixth</i>, and last clause of this panegyrick,
<small>WAS RECEIVED UP INTO GLORY</small>.</p>

<p>And this circumstance was proper to shut up
so stupendous a scene. It opened with a view
of <i>God manifest in the flesh</i>, degraded, eclipsed,
obscured by this material vestment; yet emerging
out of its dark shade through the countenance
of the <i>spirit</i>, and by the ministry of
<i>angels</i>; then shining out in the face of the
<i>Gentiles</i>, and gradually ascending to his meridian
height in the conversion of the whole
<i>world</i>. Yet was this prize of glory to be won
by a long and painful conflict with dangers,
sufferings, and death; in regard to which last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
enemy (the most alarming of all) the Apostle
affirms, that <i>it was not possible for so divine
a person to be holden of it</i><a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. It follows, therefore,
naturally and properly (to vindicate the
Redeemer’s honour, and to replace him in that
celestial state, from which he had descended),
that, in his own person, he triumphed over
hell and the grave, and went up visibly into
heaven; there to sit down at the right hand of
the Father, till, his great mediatorial scheme
being accomplished, he himself shall voluntarily
quit the distinction of his name and place,
and <small>GOD SHALL BE ALL IN ALL</small><a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.</p>

<p>On this brief comment on the text, thus far
unfolded to you, I have but one reflexion to
make. Ye will not derive from it a clearer insight
into the reasons of all the wonders presented
to you: for I undertook only to lay before
you those wonders themselves; not to
account to you for them: but, if ye feel yourselves
touched with a view of these things; if
ye find your hearts impressed with an awful
sense of your divine religion, and <i>nourished</i><a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
in the faith of it, then will ye be in a way to
reap that fruit from this discourse, which is
better than all wisdom and all knowledge; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
fruit of <small>HOLINESS</small>, in this short but unspeakably
momentous stage of your existence; and of
<small>HAPPINESS</small> without measure, and without end,
in the kingdom of glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<h2 id="SERMON_XXXIV">SERMON XXXIV.<br />
<span class="medium">PREACHED MAY 19, 1776.</span></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> l. 11.</h3>

<p><i>Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass
yourselves about with sparks; Walk in the
light of your fire, and in the sparks which
ye have kindled: This shall ye have of my
hand, ye shall lie down in sorrow.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> expression, we see, is figurative. By
the <i>fire kindled</i>, and the <i>sparks, with which
men compass themselves about</i>, may, indeed,
be understood any of those worldly comforts,
such as honours, riches, and pleasures, which
the generality of men are studious to procure
to themselves; and in the <i>light</i> of which they
love to walk, as being that, which, in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
opinion, contributes most to warm, to chear,
and illustrate human life.</p>

<p>The effect, however, of these comforts, is,
that they who possess the largest share of them,
and seek for no other, <i>lie down in sorrow</i>:
that is, their lives are without joy, and their
end is without hope. This is the recompense,
which they receive from <i>the hand of God</i>; as
might easily be shewn, if my purpose, at this
time, were to enlarge of that common-place in
morals, <i>the unsatisfactory nature of all earthly
enjoyments</i>.</p>

<p>But my design is to engage your thoughts on
a different argument, to which the letter of the
text more directly leads us. For <i>light</i>, in all
languages, is the emblem of knowledge; which
is to the mind, what that is to the eye: And,
the speaker in the text being God himself, we
are naturally led to interpret that light, of <i>religious
knowledge</i>; that genial fire, which,
more than the Sun itself, is necessary to warm
our spirits, and guide our steps through the
cold and dark passage of this life.</p>

<p>The question is, Whether we are to kindle
this <i>fire</i>, for ourselves; or, whether we should
not derive it, if we have it in our power so to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
do, immediately from heaven: Whether we
shall do best to walk in the light of those few
<i>sparks</i>, which our Reason is able to strike out
for us, on the subject of religion; or, whether
it will not be our interest, and should not be
our choice, to take the benefit of that pure and
steady flame, which Revelation holds out to us.</p>

<p>The text, in a severe, indignant irony, refers
us to the former of these expedients, the better
to excite our attention to the latter. <i>Walk</i>,
says the Almighty, addressing himself to the
idolaters of human reason, <i>Walk in the light
of your fire, and in the sparks which ye have
kindled</i>. But to what end is this advice given?
To one, they little dreamt of, and would surely
avoid—<i>This ye shall have of my hand</i>, in recompense
of all your speculations, <i>Ye shall lie
down in sorrow</i>.</p>

<p>It seems, then, to be the purpose of the text,
to inculcate this great truth, <i>That Revelation
is the only sure and comfortable guide in matters
of religion</i>. And, to second this purpose,
so energetically expressed by the prophet, I
would now shew you, that all the <i>sparks</i> of
human knowledge, on this important subject,
are but smoke; and all the <i>fire</i>, which human
genius or industry can kindle at the altar of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
human reason, ice itself; when compared with
the light and heat of divine Revelation.</p>

<p>I <small>SUPPOSE</small>, that we are all convinced of what
the voice of nature so loudly proclaims, that
there is a God, a moral governor of the world;
and that we are intimately related to him, and
dependant upon him. The sum of our religious
inquiries will then be</p>

<p>I. <i>What we are to do, in order to obtain
the favour of that God: And</i></p>

<p>II. <i>What that favour is, which, when we
have done our best, we have reason to expect
from him.</i></p>

<p>Now, it will be easy to shew, that the issue
of our best reason, in the former of these enquiries,
is suspense and doubt; and despair,
or disappointment, in the latter. It will appear,
that we cannot assure ourselves of the
means, by which the favour of Heaven is to be
obtained; and that the highest degree of favour,
we have a right to claim, is not that to which
we aspire. So fated are we, when trusting to
the faint, delusive light of our own minds, on
this great, this only important subject, <i>to lie
down in sorrow</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>I. To begin with the consideration of <i>what
we are to do, in order to obtain the favour of
God</i>.</p>

<p>That we are to <i>worship</i> God, will be allowed
by all reasonable theists.</p>

<p>But in what way is he to be worshipped?
By <small>GIFTS AND OFFERINGS</small>? So a great part of
the world has believed. But, by <i>what</i> gifts
and offerings, <i>how</i>, and <i>when</i>, and <i>where</i>, and
<i>by whom</i> presented? Are <i>all</i> indifferent to
him, and is no preference due to some above
others? or, may not my offering lose its value,
unless made in a certain <i>manner</i>? Is it of no
moment with what <i>rites</i> I tender my gifts to
God? Are all <i>seasons</i> equally fit; are all
<i>places</i> equally pure; are all <i>persons</i> equally
hallowed, for the oblation of them?</p>

<p>Or, again, are gifts and offerings, to the
lord of all things, impertinent and vain? And
is my reverence of him to be expressed by acts
of <small>SELF-DENIAL</small>, <small>PENANCE</small>, AND <small>MORTIFICATION</small>?
So the pious of all times have very generally
conceived. But by <i>what</i> penance, to what <i>end</i>
referred, to what <i>degree</i> carried, and how <i>long</i>
continued?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>We may think of these questions, and of
ourselves, what we will. But such questions,
as these, have been asked by wise men, and,
when those wise men had only to take council
of their own reason, have rarely been answered
to their satisfaction.</p>

<p>Or, let us advance a step further, and say
that our dependance on God is to be signified,
and his favour obtained, by <small>PRAYER</small>: that gifts
are mercenary, and penance servile; both, a
manifest affront to the all-sufficient and all-merciful
Deity; and that the supplications of a
devout mind are the only incense fit for heaven.
Be it so: Good and wise men have at all times
thought highly of prayer; and are generally
agreed in recommending it as the most becoming
expression of human piety. But here
again, doubts and difficulties meet us. <i>How</i>
are we to pray, and for <i>what</i>?</p>

<p>Are all <i>forms</i> of address equally acceptable
to him, we adore? The Gentile world thought
not: they were solicitous to petition their Gods
in a certain style, and to gain their ear by some
favourite appellation. Let this, again, pass for
a scruple of superstition. Still, is it indifferent
with what sentiments we approach the throne of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
God, and with what ideas of his nature and
attributes we prostrate ourselves before him?
If those sentiments or ideas be not suited, in
some degree, to the majesty of that great being,
is there no danger that we may dishonour, may
injure, may insult him by our addresses? May
not our very prayers become affronts, and our
praises, blasphemies?</p>

<p>And is it so easy to think justly on this mysterious
subject, as that reason, every man’s
own reason, can instruct him? What if two
or three divine men of the pagan world guessed
right? Was their opinion any rule, was it
even any authority, to the bulk of worshippers<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>?</p>

<p>But say, that it was their own fault to misconceive
of the Deity: still, for <i>what</i> shall
they pray to him? For every thing, they
want or wish? But thus, they would most
commonly pray amiss, for what they should
pray against, for what would corrupt and hurt
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>These difficulties, with regard both to the
mode and matter of this duty, appeared so
great to the old masters of wisdom, that some<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
of them thought it the highest effort of human
wit, to form a reasonable prayer; and others
supposed that none but God himself could instruct
man how to do it<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.</p>

<p>There is a way, indeed, to cut these difficulties
short; which is, by maintaining, as
some<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> have done, that prayer is no duty at all;
but a vain superfluous observance, justly ranked
with the fancies of superstition: that God is
not honoured by any external, no, nor by any
mental, applications to him: that a good conscience<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
is true piety, and a spotless life, the
only religion.</p>

<p>Admit this exalted idea of divine worship;
yet, where shall we find, among the sons of
Adam, one such worshipper? Who shall lay
claim to that conscience, or this life? Where
is the man, that passes a single day, an hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
almost, without doing that which he ought
not to do, or omitting somewhat he ought to
have done? And what multitudes are there,
who cover themselves with infamy, and with
crimes?</p>

<p>And what shall the trembling mind do, when
it looks up, as at times it cannot help doing,
to that God, who <i>is of purer eyes, than to behold
iniquity</i>?</p>

<p><i>Repent</i>, it will be said: that species of piety
is all-powerful with Heaven; it can efface sin,
and restore tranquillity.</p>

<p>Here, again, the general sense of mankind
runs another way. For, if it be so clear, that
repentance alone has this virtue, how came the
idea of atonement and expiation into the
world? and whence the almost universal practice
of <i>propitiatory sacrifices</i>?</p>

<p>It is easy, no doubt, to brand this disposition
of the human mind, as so many others,
with the opprobrious name of superstition.
Let us see, then, what the merits and claims
are, of <i>Repentance itself</i>.</p>

<p>A man offends against God, and the sense of
his own mind. On reflexion (what can he do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
less?) he repents; and (if it please God) is
forgiven. But passion revives; he offends again,
and repents again; and so goes on, through his
whole life, in a course of alternate transgression,
and repentance. And is this all the claim he
has to be received, at length, into the favour of
God, that he never sinned, though he did it
every day, but he was sorry for it?</p>

<p>Yes, you will say, <i>If my brother trespass
against me seven times in a day, and seven
times in a day turn again and repent</i>, I am
bound by the law of Christ himself to forgive
him<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. And will God be less placable, than his
creature man is required to be<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>?</p>

<p>This rule of conduct is very fit to be observed
by one offender towards another: but is it past
a doubt that it will, that it must take place
between God and man? <small>WE</small> are bound to this
repeated, this continual forgiveness of others,
by a sense of our common infirmities. <small>HE</small> has
a government to support; of what extent, over
what worlds, and how connected with this, no
man may say: And what would become of
government in this world, if every convict was
to be pardoned on repentance?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>Nor is it enough to reply, that human governors
cannot pronounce on the sincerity of
such repentance. If they could, they would
certainly not regulate their proceedings by that
consideration. The law has denounced a penalty
on such a crime: And the public interest
requires that the penalty, for example-sake, be
inflicted.</p>

<p>Something, like this, may be true of God’s
moral government. No man can say, it is not.
And therefore repentance, as plausible as its
plea may appear, can never free the guilty mind
from all apprehension.</p>

<p>But another dreadful circumstance attends
this matter. We often satisfy ourselves, that
we repent of a past crime: Yet we commit that
crime again; perhaps the very next hour.
Can we call that repentance sincere? Or, have
we a right to conclude that God, who sees
through all the prevarication and duplicity of
our hearts, must accept such repentance, on
our profession of it? Let what virtue there will
be in repentance, when seen by the unerring
eye of God to be true and unfeigned, how shall
man reckon on the efficacy of it, when he may
so easily mistake, and cannot certainly know
the real worth and character of what he calls
repentance?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>Here then, whether we consider what the
moral attributes of the Deity, and his righteous
government, may demand; or whether we
regard the weakness and inefficacy of our best
purposes; there is room enough for the terrors
of religion to invade and possess the mind, in
spite of all that Reason can do to repell, or
dislodge them from it.</p>

<p>After all, in contemplation of that infinite
mercy which surrounds the throne of God, and
of the infirmity incident to frail man, I am
willing to suppose (as it is our common interest
to do) that <i>repentance</i>, at all times, and how
oft soever renewed, is a ground, on which he
may reasonably build fair hopes and chearful
expectations. To repent, is always the best
thing we can do: It is always a conduct right in
itself; and, as such, is intitled, we will say, on
the principles of natural religion, to the divine
acceptance.</p>

<p>But what does that <small>ACCEPTANCE</small> import?
<i>The reward of eternal life? A remission of all
punishment? or, only an abatement of it?</i>
Here, again, fresh difficulties start up, and
come to be considered,</p>

<p>II. Under the second general head of this
discourse; in which it was proposed to inquire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
<i>What that favour is, which, when we have done
our best to recommend ourselves to God, we
have reason to expect at his hands?</i></p>

<p>1. If presumptuous man could learn to estimate
himself at his true worth, he might
perhaps see reason to conclude, that his highest
moral merit can pretend to no more, than
to some <i>abatement</i> of present or future punishment.</p>

<p>Let him calculate how oft, how knowingly,
how willfully he hath offended; and, on the
other hand, when he did his duty, how coldly,
how remissly, how reluctantly he did it: with
what a gust of passion he disobeyed; and
with what indifference he repented: with how
full a consent of his mind, with what deliberation,
and against what conviction, he sinned;
and then, again, with what hesitation, by what
degrees, in what circumstances, and upon what
motives, he recovered himself from any bad
habit: In a word, how full and complete and
contagious his vices have been; and how faint
and partial and ineffective, his best virtues:
Let him, I say, calculate all this, and then tell
us where is the stock of merit, on the balance
of the account, that should encourage him to
do more than hope that some part of the punishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
he hath justly incurred, may by a merciful
judge be struck off, in consideration of
his virtues? If such a man recovered his
health, when he left his intemperance; or his
credit in the world, when he shook hands with
his injustice; or, if his penitence could avail
so far as to shorten the term, or qualify the
rigour, of his sufferings in some other state
of being, would he not have reason to think
he had all the recompense he deserved? Could
most men, at least, on a strict scrutiny of their
hearts and lives, carry their pretensions higher?
But,</p>

<p>2. But let us be indulgent to human virtue,
and suppose it pure and active enough to work
out all the guilt, which vice had contracted,
could it do more than cancel the punishment
due to vice, and should we be authorized to
expect more than a <i>full remission</i> of it? Suppose,
that after a long life, checquered with
good and bad actions, but in such sort as that
the good equalled the bad, and perfectly atoned
for them (and which of us will say, that this
is not a favourable supposition?); suppose, I
say, that after such a life, as this, the whole
man were suffered to fall into a state of insensibility,
that all his powers and faculties were
suspended, or the man himself utterly extinguished,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
could we complain of this allotment,
or could reason pretend that it was not according
to the rules of strict justice?</p>

<p>3. Still I agree to make a further concession
to the pride of Virtue. Let the moral qualities
of some men be so excellent, and the tenour
of their lives so pure, as to entitle them to a
<i>positive reward</i> from the great searcher of
hearts and inspector of human actions: would
not the daily blessings of this life be a suitable
recompense for such desert; would not health,
and prosperity, and reputation, and peace of
mind, be an adequate return for their best services?
Or, if all this did not satisfy their
claims, could they require more than such a
portion of happiness in a future state, as should
correspond to their merits, and make them
full amends for all the sacrifices they here
made to Conscience and to Virtue? And might
not a small degree of such happiness, and for
a short term, be an equivalent for such sacrifices?
Could they dream of living <i>for ever</i>,
and of living <i>happily</i> for ever in heaven; and
call such a reward, as this, a debt, a claim
of right, which could not justly be withheld
from them? Could any man in his senses
pretend, even to himself, that a Virtue of sixty
or seventy years, though ever so perfect, ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
so constant, deserved immortal life in bliss and
glory? Incredible: impossible: the merit and
the recompense are too widely disjoined, the
disproportion between them is too vast, to give
the least colour of reason to such expectations.
A Saint, or a Martyr, has no claim of
right to so immense a reward, so transcendant
a felicity.</p>

<p>’Tis true, Christianity gives us these hopes,
which Reason forwardly assumes, and makes
her own; forgetting at the same time, or unthankfully
slighting, the only grounds on which
they are founded. For, though eternal life be
promised to favoured man in the Gospel, it is
there promised to him, not as a debt, but as a
free gift; and that, not in consideration of his
good works, but of his faith in Jesus.</p>

<p>See then, to what the hopes of nature, the conclusions
of reason and philosophy, amount, on this
interesting subject. We are in the hands of an
all-wise and all-righteous God, and are undone
without his favour. Yet how that favour is to
be obtained, we know not; or, if we do know,
we are unable of ourselves to obtain it in the
degree, we wish, and to the ends, for which
we aspire to it. Our best speculations on the
<i>means</i> of propitiating Heaven, are mixed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
uncertainty; and our best <i>hopes</i> dashed with
mistrust and suspicion. For what man is so
righteous as to have perfect confidence in his
good works; or, so sanguine, as to think heaven
the due reward of them? And yet will any
thing, short of this, content our impatient
desires? Should our virtues merit no more
than some abatement of future misery, so justly
due to our innumerable ill deserts, how sad a
prospect have we before us? or, if they do but
free us from punishment, what man is so abject
as not to shudder at the thought of extinction
or insensibility? or, lastly, if they supply some
faint hope of future reward, what generous
man but wishes more to himself, than a slight,
a precarious, and short-lived happiness; beyond
which, as we have seen, he has no right to extend
his expectations?</p>

<p>If the Gentiles, who had only the light of
Nature to conduct them, had no way to get
quit of these doubts and fears, their condition
was certainly unhappy, but would bespeak the
mercy of God: their disadvantages and distresses
would be allowed for, and considered
by him. But for those, who have now the
light of Heaven shining about them, and yet
chuse to walk in the dim, disastrous twilight of
their own reason, what must be their folly, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
well as misery? I say, their <i>misery</i>. For this
last is no secret to observing men, notwithstanding
the airs of gaiety and satisfaction, they
sometimes assume; and indeed deserves the
tenderest pity, though their perverse <i>folly</i> be
apt to excite a different passion.</p>

<p>But to conclude: It is enough to have shewn,
in justification of the sacred text, that they
who <i>walk in the light of their own fire, and
in the sparks which they have kindled</i>, have
this recompense of their choice, allotted to
them by the hand of God, and the nature of
things, <i>That they</i> do and must <i>lie down in
sorrow</i>.</p>

<p>To you, who have determined more wisely
to govern yourselves by faith, and not by Reason
only; who rejoice to walk in the clear sunshine
of the blessed Gospel, and not in the
malignant light of philosophical speculation,
To you, I say, the reward of your better conduct,
is, that ye know how to recommend
yourselves to the favour of God; and ye know
what to expect from that favour: Ye understand
that, by <small>FAITH AND REPENTANCE</small>, ye have peace
of mind in this transitory life, and assured
hopes of immortal unspeakable felicity, reserved
for you in the heavens.</p>

<p><i>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that
are lost.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> text implies, that the evidence, with
which Christianity is attended, may fail of
convincing the minds of some men. And indeed
from the time that <i>the Sun of righteousness</i>
rose upon the earth, there have always
been those, who could not, or would not, be
enlightened by Him.</p>

<p>Now it might be a question, whether this
effect were owing to the nature of the evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
itself, or to some obscurity in the manner of
proposing it. This, I say, might have been a
question, even among Christians themselves,
if the Apostle had not determined it to our
hands. He who was fully instructed in the
truths of the Gospel, knew the evidence, with
which they were accompanied, was enlightened
by the same spirit that had inspired them, and
had great experience in the different tempers
and capacities of men, roundly asserts that
Infidelity has no countenance, either from
within or without, neither from the sort or
degree of evidence, by which the Christian
Revelation is supported, nor from any mysterious
conveyance of it; but that, universally,
the fault lies in those, who do not receive it.
<i>If the Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that
are lost</i>: to those, who would not be convinced
by any evidence whatsoever.</p>

<p>What the evidences of Christianity, in fact,
are, and how abundantly sufficient for the
conviction of all reasonable men, I shall not
now enquire. The subject is fitter for a volume,
than a discourse in this place. Let it
be supposed, on St. Paul’s authority, that
those evidences are sufficient; still ye may be
curious to know, and it may tend to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
establishment of your faith to understand, how
it has come to pass, that so much light could
be resisted.</p>

<p>To this question a pertinent answer has been
given from the prejudices and passions, from
the vices and corruptions of unbelievers; it
being no new thing that men should <i>love
darkness rather than light</i>, when <i>their deeds
are</i>, and when they have resolved with themselves
they shall be, <i>evil</i><a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. <i>For</i>, as our Lord
himself argues in this case, <i>Every one that
doth evil, hateth the light, lest his deeds should
be reproved: But he that doth the Truth,
cometh to the light, that his deeds may be manifested,
that they are wrought in God</i><a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>.</p>

<p>But then it has been replied, that, though
Vice may be many times the ground of infidelity,
and the condemnation of such men be
just, yet that some, too, have disbelieved from
no such motives; that the Gospel has been rejected
by persons, who appear to have been
men of large and liberal minds, as free, as
others, from all perverse prejudices, and as
little subject to gross vice or passion: Nay,
that, in the class of unbelievers, there have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
been those who have distinguished themselves
as much by the purity of their lives, as the
brightness of their understandings.</p>

<p>All this may be true; and yet our Saviour
affirms, <i>that he, who believeth not, is condemned
already</i><a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>; and St. Paul in the text,
to the same purpose, <i>that if the Gospel be hid,
it is hid to them that are lost</i>. There must
needs, then, be some latent cause of this strange
fact; some secret depravity lurking in the mind
of those, who disbelieve the Gospel, thought
appearances be thus fair and flattering. And,
though Christian Charity be not forward <i>to
think evil</i> of his neighbour, yet in this case
we have reason to suspect it: and what we suspect,
we may perhaps find, in a <small>VICE</small> so secret
and insinuating, that it creeps upon men unawares;
so congenial, as it were, to our depraved
nature, that hardly any man can be sure
of his being wholly free from it; and so ingenious
in disguising itself, as to pass upon others,
nay upon the man possessed by it, for one of
his best qualities.</p>

<p>By these characters, ye will easily see I speak
of self-love, or rather the vicious exertion of it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
in what we call, <small>PRIDE</small>: A vice, which may as
fatally obstruct our pursuit of Truth, as any
the most vulgar immorality; and the rather,
because it is not easily suspected or acknowledged
by us.</p>

<p>This vice then it may be, that <i>hides the
Gospel from those</i> better sort of men, <i>to whom
it is hid</i>. They had need examine themselves
well, for it assumes, as I said, the most imposing
forms. Who would look for it, in the
cultivation of the mind, and the love of Virtue?
Yet in either of these, it may lie concealed:
and an inquirer into the truth of the most rational,
and the purest of all religions, may be
prejudiced against it by a double Pride, by the
<small>PRIDE OF REASON</small>, and the <small>PRIDE OF VIRTUE</small>.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">First</span>, <i>Infidelity may proceed from the
Pride of Reason</i>.</p>

<p>When it pleased God to bestow the faculty
of Reason on his creature, Man, he intended
that this substitute of himself should be the
guide of life, and the handmaid of Religion.
And that it might serve to these purposes, it
was made sagacious enough, if honestly exerted,
to lead him to some competent knowledge
of his Maker, and of his moral duty, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
to judge of the pretensions of any further light
from Heaven, which might be graciously vouchsafed
to him.</p>

<p>Man, proud of this free Gift, was in haste to
make trial of its strength; and finding it could
do something, too easily concluded it could do
every thing. Yet its weakness soon appeared;
first, in man’s transgression, and consequent
forfeiture of another free Gift, that of immortality;
and next, in the portentous errors he
fell into, both in respect of virtue and religion.
For God, who had graciously intended for
him, in due time, another and safer guide, to
prepare him for the reception of it, and to
convince him, in the mean time, how much
it was wanted, had suffered him to abuse this,
to the worst purposes, of immorality, and
idolatry: by both which the earth was generally
overspread for many ages, and even in the
most enlightened times, notwithstanding his
Reason might, and should have taught him
better.</p>

<p>But God’s wisdom and goodness foresaw this
abuse, and provided, from the first, for the correction
of it. He had signified his purpose
from the moment of man’s transgression, and
afterwards by a gradual opening of his scheme,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
in many successive revelations; all terminating
in that universal redemption of mankind by
the sacrifice, and through the Gospel, of his
Son. This last and greatest instance of the
divine love for man, it might be expected, after
so much experience of his own debility and
folly, he would gladly and thankfully receive;
and, that he might be qualified to discern the
hand of God from the practices of fallible and
designing men, was one main end, as I said,
which God designed in lighting up the lamp
of Reason in him.</p>

<p>But now this boasted Guide, though found
to be poor and weak, grew proud and presumptuous.
It would not only judge of the credentials
of divine Revelation (which was its
proper office, and without which faculty of
judging there could be no security from the
endless impostures of fanaticism and superstition,
but not content with this power) it would
decide peremptorily on the nature and fitness
of the Revelation itself; and would either admit
none, or such only, as it should perfectly
comprehend.</p>

<p>Here, then, Reason forgot its own use, and
power: its use, which was to bring him to the
acknowledgement of a divine Religion; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
its power, which did not enable him to judge
of the infinite counsels of God, but to try
whether any such were revealed to him. In a
word, he forgot that his utmost capacity extended
no farther than just to see whether the
proposed Revelation were such as might come
from God, as contradicting no clear and certain
principles of reason, and whether the
evidences were such as proved that it did so. If
it contained nothing repugnant to right Reason,
that is, to a prior light derived from the same
source of Truth, it might come from Heaven;
if the attestations of it were clear and convincing,
it must proceed from that quarter. To
try its credibility and authority, was then
within the province of Reason: to determine
of its absolute necessity and fitness, and to
explore the depth and height of those counsels,
on which it is framed, was above its reach and
comprehension.</p>

<p>Yet Reason assumed to herself, too generally,
this latter office; and this I call, the
<small>PRIDE</small> of Reason. Hence all its wanderings
and miscarriages; from this perverse application
of its powers arose all the heresies that have
distracted the Christian Church, and all the infidel
systems that have been invented to overthrow
it. In both cases, men would be wise
<i>above</i>, or <i>against, what was written</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>Of the Heresies, I have nothing to say at this
time. They appear at large in the ecclesiastical
historian. Of the dreams of infidelity, as arising
from the fumes of pride, so much is to be said,
as my present subject requires of me, but this
in as few words as possible.</p>

<p><i>The pride of Reason</i> has then pronounced
(as it operated at different times, and on different
tempers), that Revelation is unnecessary,
because Reason could see and discover by its
own light all that was needful to our direction
and happiness—that, if it were wanted by us,
it was impossible to be given consistently with
the laws of nature and experience—that as to
that pretended scheme of Revelation, called
the Gospel, its morality indeed was pure
enough, but that it carried no other internal
marks of its divinity: that its doctrines were
such as Reason would not expect, and in many
cases could not understand: that it talked of
divine things in a manner that was strange and
extraordinary; of a purpose to redeem mankind
which, if it were needful at all, might have
been effected by more rational and less operose
methods; and to save and sanctify them by
such means as seemed fanciful and delusive:
that the divine nature was spoken of in high
mysterious terms, which puzzle and confound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
our Metaphysics; and that the offices, in which
the Godhead was employed, are either degrading,
or such as imply an immoderate and inconceivable
condescension.</p>

<p>And what then, say others, is the basis on
which this incredible Revelation rests? Why
on <i>Miracles</i>, which we cannot admit, as being
violations or suspensions of those laws, by
which we know the Supreme Being governs
the world; and on <i>Prophecies</i>, which may
have been feigned, as many have been, or
which imply such a prescience in the Deity of
free contingent events, as is perhaps impossible.
If the Gospel then is to be admitted as a truly
divine Revelation, convince us, that its external
proofs are above all doubt and suspicion;
and that all its internal characters are such as
lie open to the perfect scrutiny, and entire investigation
of our faculties.</p>

<p>Thus does the Pride of Reason vaunt itself,
against Reason. For, if to any or all of these
objections (on which so many infidel systems
hang) we should only say, <i>that they are nothing
to the purpose</i>, what could the objectors
reply to us? If pressed closely, they could
only take refuge in this principle, <i>that no
Religion can be divine, all the reasons of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
which are not fully known to us</i>; a principle,
for which they have surely no warrant from
right Reason. How do they know what is
necessary, or fit, or right, with regard to the
divine dispensations, I mean (which is the case
here) when they only silence, not contradict
our Reason? Every thing may be fit and right,
and might appear to be so, if the whole
scheme of Providence were fully unveiled to
us. It must be fit and right, whether we see
it or no, if the Religion in question be credibly
attested: And the credibility will depend not
on our fancies or expectations of I know not
what irresistible evidence (which it might be
best and wisest not to give) but on the real
moment of the arguments, on which it is
established.</p>

<p>So that the last effort of Infidelity is only an
appeal to the ignorance of mankind; which
proves nothing but the necessity of a long-forgotten
virtue, Modesty, in our researches
into Religion.</p>

<p>We see then how the <i>Pride of Reason</i> has
betrayed presumptuous men into a disbelief of
Revelation, and how true it is that, <i>if the Gospel
be hid, it is hid to them that are lost</i>, as well
by <i>this</i> means, as by any other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>II. But, secondly, there is <small>A PRIDE OF VIRTUE</small>,
as well as of Reason: and by this Pride, too,
(such is the infirmity of our common nature)
<i>the Gospel may be hid from us</i>.</p>

<p>On whatever foundation a man chuses to
build his moral system, he easily convinces
himself of the worth and excellence of moral
action. The reasonableness, the utility, and
the beauty of Virtue are so conspicuous, that
even the vicious look up to her with respect,
and the virtuous easily grow enamoured of her.
Thus it came to be among the extravagances
of the Stoics, its best friends in the pagan
world, that virtue was not only the perfection
of man’s nature, but that it raised him in some
sense, above the Divine<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. And to make their
arrogant system all of a piece, they further
maintained that this super-celestial virtue, in
which they gloried, was their own proper acquisition;
that they derived it wholly from
themselves, and that God did not, and could
not give it<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>This, you will say, was stoical pride; but
it is, too commonly, also, the pride of virtue,
of whatever denomination. Penetrated with a
lively sense of its use and excellence, virtuous
men, especially of a certain temperament, take
fire from their own heated ideas, and flame
out into a kind of moral fanaticism. They
consider virtue, as the supreme and only good,
absolute in itself, and independant of any other.
They exalt and deify themselves in their own
imaginations; and, though their language may
be more decent, the sense of their hearts is
truly stoical.</p>

<p>See, now, whether virtue, under this intoxication,
be in a condition to benefit by the
sober truths of the Gospel. It presents to us
a frightful picture of the moral world; much
is said concerning the weakness and inefficacy
of moral virtue. This representation, of itself,
is disgusting. But one great design of the
Gospel was to reform this state of things: And
thus far is well: But by what means would it
reform it? Why, among others, by Faith and
Hope. Yet, in Faith, the proud moralist
sees no virtue, at all; and Hope, in his ideas,
degrades and servilizes his adored virtue. The
Gospel proposes to save us by the sacrifice of
Christ: But He acknowledges no need of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
sacrifice; relies, with confidence, on his own
merits; and disdains the notion of an intercessor.
He holds, that nothing more could
be intended by a Revelation, if such were
given, than the promotion of our virtue; and
that we want not its aid, for that purpose:
that we read our duty in the sense of our own
minds; which Reason enforces in as high terms,
as the Gospel, in a more engaging way, and
on principles more sublime and generous.</p>

<p>Above all, the Gospel speaks much of the
succours of Grace, as necessary to infuse and
to confirm our virtue; a language, which the
<i>Pride</i> of virtue will not understand: And of a
Heaven, and a Hell; by which if any thing
more be meant than the proper natural effects
of virtue and vice itself, the idea is rejected, as
superfluous and even childish.</p>

<p>To such an extreme of folly, and even impiety,
may the Pride of virtue carry us; and
so fatally may <i>the Gospel be hid from those</i>,
whom this last infirmity of human nature
blinds by its specious illusions! And that this
is no ideal picture, but one taken from the
life, will appear to those who know any thing
of human nature; and of the perverse prejudices,
by which some ingenious, and otherwise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
virtuous men, have suffered themselves to
be misled in their religious inquiries<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to shew the issue of
intellectual and moral <i>Pride</i>: And how it
comes to pass that men <i>lose</i> themselves, who
reason, on Religion, without modesty, or would
be virtuous without Religion.</p>

<p>The application is short, but striking. It is,
That men should examine themselves well,
before they presume to think slightly of the
Gospel. They may learn to suspect the power
and influence of their grosser passions, when
they see that even these refined ones may
corrupt their judgement, and betray them into
Infidelity.</p>

<p>The Apostle says expressly, that <i>if the Gospel
be hid, it is hid to them that are lost</i>: and
who, that rejects the Gospel, but must tremble
for himself, when his <small>REASON</small>, nay his <small>VIRTUE</small>,
may be the instrument of his ruin?</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">These</span> words have been often and justly
quoted to prove the rational genius of our
religion: but they have sometimes been
quoted to prove much more, “The obligation,
that Christians are under, to justify their

<p>1. Who the persons are, to whom this

to give a reason of such hope.</p>

<p>The resolution of these questions will afford

<p>1. St. Peter addresses himself to <i>the elect
strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia,
Cappadocia, Asia, and Bythinia</i>—i. e.
most probably, to Jewish Christians, dispersed
through these countries, in which they were
properly <i>strangers</i>; though, in some sense,
all good men are strangers and sojourners on
earth, and therefore the use of this term may
not necessarily exclude such Heathen converts
to the faith, as lived in those quarters. But
whatever be the precise meaning of the term,
it is clear, that all persons of this general
denomination, or all the <i>stranger</i> Christians,
residing in the places, here mentioned, are,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
without distinction, concerned in this catholic
epistle. There is not a word that implies any
difference of age, or sex, or education, or
rank: not the least regard is had to the office
of some, or the qualifications of others: all
indiscriminately, of the class specified, who
had knowledge and understanding enough to
profess themselves Christians, are the objects
of the Apostle’s address: and of these, universally,
is the requisition made, that they be
<i>ready always to give an answer to every man,
that asketh a reason of the hope that is in
them</i>. But what then</p>

<p>2. Is that <i>Hope</i>, of which all such persons
were expected and required to render a reason?
Plainly the general hope of Christians, the
hope of eternal life, the hope of a resurrection
from the dead, the blessed hope, in short, of
salvation through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The context shews, that it was this hope,
and this only, of which they were to give an
account. For, in the preceding verse, the
Apostle had been speaking of the trials which
they should undergo for the sake of their religion.
Possibly, they were, then, in a state of
persecution; or, it was foreseen that they soon
would be in that state. <i>But and if ye suffer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
says he, for righteousness sake, happy are ye.</i>
Why? because they knew the <i>hope</i> of their
calling, and the ample recompense that would
be made them in a future life for all such sufferings.
Therefore, he advises that they should
always have this precious hope present to
them, and well established in their minds:
nay, and that, for their own better support in
the midst of their sufferings, and for the vindication
of themselves to others, their persecutors,
perhaps, who might ask on what
grounds they exposed themselves to such torments,
they should have in readiness an <i>answer</i>,
or apology for their own conduct, setting
forth the reason they had to confide in that
hope; from which reason it would appear that
they acted, as became prudent men, and not
as blind, frantic enthusiasts.</p>

<p>It being now seen, to whom the text is
directed, and what the <i>hope</i>, under consideration,
is, we have no difficulty in
answering</p>

<p>3. The last question, “What the proper
<i>answer</i> might, or rather must be, of such
persons, when required to give a reason of
such hope?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>For what other answer could they give (and
this they all might give), than that their Lord
and Master, Jesus Christ, by whom they had
been encouraged to entertain this hope, had
shewn himself well able to make it good by
his own resurrection? They might say, in
the words of the Apostle Paul (who apologized
for himself to the Athenians, in like circumstances),
We therefore think ourselves happy
in suffering for righteousness sake,—<i>because
God hath appointed a day in the which he
will judge the world in righteousness, by that
man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath
given assurance unto all men, in that he hath
raised him from the dead</i><a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.</p>

<p>This was an obvious reason of the <i>hope,
that was in them</i>, and level to all capacities.
It was, also, a sufficient reason, if it was any
at all, that is, if the fact alleged be true;
and, that it was so, they might appeal to the
testimony of those, who had seen the Lord
and conversed with him, after his resurrection;
nay, whom themselves had seen confirming
that testimony <i>by signs and wonders</i>, done in
the name of Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>We see, then, what is the true and full
meaning of the text. The Apostle exhorts
those, to whom he writes, all of them, the
simpler, as well as more informed, to bear in
mind the end of their religion, <small>EVERLASTING
LIFE</small>; and the grounds, on which they expected
it, the <small>WORD</small> of their divine <small>MASTER</small>, <i>confirmed
to them by them that heared him</i><a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>, and by his
rising from the dead.</p>

<p>And now we are at liberty to make some reflexions
on the text, which may be useful and
instructive to us.</p>

<p>And, first, I observe, as most others have
done, that Christians are allowed and encouraged
to reason on the subject of their religion,
and to build their faith on conviction. For the
Apostle’s advice is, not to decline the way of
argument, but to use such arguments as are
cogent and satisfactory. And in this free exercise
of the understanding, which is permitted,
or rather enjoined to all Christians,
the manly genius of our religion is seen, and
by it is distinguished from that of every blind
and servile superstition. But then,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>Secondly, I observe, that this work of reason
is enjoined, only, with regard to <i>the hope, that
is in us</i>, that is, to the end and scope of
Christianity, and to the authority on which it
rests; in other words, with regard to the
<small>EVIDENCES</small> of this Religion.</p>

<p>It is true, these evidences are a different
thing to different persons, according to their
respective situations. To the primitive
Christians, such as those to whom the exhortation
of the text is addressed, it was
evidence sufficient, “That they had the great
facts of the Gospel, especially that decisive
fact, the resurrection of Christ, reported to
them by persons, who had been eye-witnesses
of those extraordinary transactions,
or, who had heared them, at least, from
eye-witnesses, and were endowed, besides,
with the power of working miracles in confirmation
of their testimony.” For in those
days, it is to be observed, they, who were
commissioned to plant the Gospel in the
world, <i>went forth, and preached every where,
the Lord working with them, and confirming
the word with signs following</i><a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>This state of things continued through
what is called the Apostolic Age, and perhaps
longer, during which time it was easy for the
plainest Christian to give such an <i>answer</i>, to
these who required a reason of <i>the hope that
was in him</i>, as was perfectly satisfactory. But,
when the Gospels were admitted by the faithful,
as authentic accounts of their Master’s history
and doctrine, and when the Apostles had
further drawn out and explained the principles
and proofs of Christianity in their several
writings, that is, when the Canon of the New
Testament was completed, and generally received
(all which was done within the first
century from the Christian æra), Then the
appeal lay to these scriptures, and the ground
of a Christian’s persuasion was, the authority
of the inspired writers. And now, if believers
were asked the reason of <i>the hope that was in
them</i>, the answer was, “That so it was written
in books, which were in all hands, and allowed
by all to contain nothing but infallible
truth.” Nor could the force of this answer
be disputed, when the memory of certain
facts was recent, when the places where,
and the person to whom, or for whose use
the sacred books were written, could be
pointed out, and when the writers of them
were known, by the miracles wrought by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
them, to have been under the direction of the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>On the conviction, which this apology carried
with it, the world became Christian. But
in process of time, and after a course of many
ages, it might be doubted whether those books
had been transmitted pure and uncorrupted.
And under these circumstances the <i>answer</i>,
being somewhat enlarged, stands thus: “That
the hope of a Christian is founded on the
authority of the sacred canon, composed by
inspired men, as was universally allowed in
the first ages of Christianity, and not materially
altered, as we have reason to believe,
to this day.”</p>

<p>The answer given in these three periods, is,
you see, very general, because the question is,
on what grounds of reason a plain man could
justify his profession of Christianity: and the
answer, in each case, is a proper one, and of
real weight. But the answer of knowing and
skilful men is more particular, may indeed be
infinitely varied and extended according to the
abilities of the answerer; and, from such minute,
and laboured apologies much additional
light and conviction hath been derived. Still
you see the subject of inquiry, is, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
<small>EVIDENCES</small> of Christianity, how different soever
in different ages, and in the view of different
persons in the same age. All that unbelievers
have a right to ask, is, on what
grounds we affirm the truth and divinity of
our religion: and the sole duty which the text
imposes upon us, is to satisfy that question.
Their curiosity, and our labour, should not, at
least needs not, be extended beyond these
bounds. But</p>

<p>Thirdly, what if inquisitive men should go
farther, and, when they have set forth the
evidences of Christianity to their own satisfaction,
and that of others, should proceed to
give us a <i>rationale</i> of its doctrines: Would not
their pains be useful, as tending very much to
promote the honour of our divine religion?</p>

<p>Perhaps, they might, if <i>soberly</i> employed
and if inquirers would set out with a resolution
of stopping in their curious researches, when
they had no ideas, or no clear or distinct
ones.</p>

<p>But, even with this restriction, <i>two</i> things
are, further, to be observed. <span class="smcap">One</span> is, that no
Christian is bound to make this solicitous inquiry
into the doctrinal, no, nor into the moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
part of the Gospel. It is enough that his faith
and life be regulated by its doctrines and precepts,
whether he do, or do not, see the
grounds in reason, on which they stand. Nay,
possibly his conduct is then most acceptable,
when he looks no farther than to the authority
of the Gospel; agreeably to that well-known
decision of our Lord himself—<i>blessed is he,
who hath not seen, and yet hath believed</i>:
not, that he expects any man to believe or to
obey him, without reason: but he most approves
the ingenuous turn of that man’s mind,
who admits his divine mission, on a sufficient
indeed, but not the highest, degree of evidence;
and much more, therefore, who yields
obedience to his laws, acknowledged on such
evidence to be divine, without inquiring further
into the reasons of them. Indeed, to what
purpose do I scrupulously ask a reason of that,
which I already know to be just and fit, because
reasonably admitted to proceed from divine
authority?</p>

<p>The <small>OTHER</small> observation I would make, is,
That, if after the most diligent inquiry, we
should not, yet, be able to penetrate the
reasons of many things, or to give ourselves
entire satisfaction about them, this unacceptable
experience should not in the least affect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
our belief and esteem of the Gospel. For all
that follows from such disappointed curiosity
is only this, That we are weak and blind; and
not that the things themselves are either false
or unreasonable. Our duty, therefore, is to
confide in the <i>revealed word</i>; not questioning
its authority, or torturing its language; but
accepting with thankfulness, what we do understand,
and with reverence, what we do
not.</p>

<p>When these two conditions are inviolably
observed, the way of minute inquiry into the
doctrines of Christianity, so far forth as they
are the objects of inquiry, at all, may be usefully
and commendably employed. For then
none but men of leisure and ability will think
themselves concerned in making such inquiry:
and even these, if they should not obtain all
the satisfaction they propose to themselves,
will neither attempt to disturb the faith of
others, nor suffer their own faith to be disturbed
by their curious speculations. Still:
when learned men are taken up in those profound
inquiries, and seem most confident that
they have penetrated far into the reasons of
many things which are kept secret from others,
they should especially remember (and that is
the Fourth, and <i>last</i> observation I shall make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
on the text), to present their <i>answer</i> or apology
to mankind, <i>with meekness and fear</i>.</p>

<p>1. With <small>MEEKNESS</small>, or a soft and gentle
spirit, breathing in words, neither passionate,
nor assuming; that so they may gain as many,
and exasperate as few, as they can. This was
a caution more than commonly necessary to
the first apologists for Christianity, who had
to plead its cause at the tribunal of Kings, at
that time, their enemies and persecutors. But
the rule is always a good one to be observed by
the advocates of the Gospel, who never serve
it better, than when its prime virtue, <small>CHARITY</small>,
corrects, or rather consecrates, their zeal.</p>

<p>2. The <i>reason of the hope, that is in them</i>,
should, also, be given <i>with</i> <small>FEAR</small>: that is, not
only with a <i>fear</i> of giving needless offence to
those, to whom they address their apology,
but chiefly with a <i>reverential awe</i> of that
transcendantly great Being, whose ways they
desire to contemplate, and some part of whose
councils it is their ambition to unfold. For,
when we speak of God, farther than we are
authorized by himself to speak, we are in constant
danger of ascribing to him our own
weaknesses, and of degrading his ineffable
wisdom, when we think to exalt it most.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>Such reason there is, even when we apologize
for the truth of God, to do it <i>with meekness
and fear</i>.</p>

<p>To conclude: Religious inquiries, when thus
conducted (and only then) are commendable
and useful. They exercise our best faculties
on the noblest subjects: They may be the
means of bringing some to the kingdom of
God, and they can alienate none from it. Or,
whatever the merit and the success of these
inquiries may be, the authors of them will
have the satisfaction of knowing, that they
have inquired in a right manner; and, that,
how little soever their <small>UNDERSTANDINGS</small> have
<i>profited</i> the Almighty<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>, they have honoured
Him with the noblest sacrifice, which a mortal
can offer to his Maker, that of an <small>HUMBLE AND
SUBMISSIVE SPIRIT</small>.</p>

<h2 id="SERMON_XXXVII">SERMON XXXVII.<br />
<span class="medium">PREACHED FEBRUARY 4, 1770.</span></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">John</span> vii. 46.</h3>

<p><i>Never man spake like this man.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">If</span> by speaking, be here meant what is called
<i>fine</i> speaking, or a discourse artificially composed
according to the rules of human eloquence, the
subject is unworthy of this place, and the
praise, infinitely disproportioned to the divine
character of Jesus. A pagan philosopher, nay,
and a Christian preacher, might haply so far
forget himself, as to affect the credit of <i>fine
speaking</i>; or, his followers might think to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
honour him by applauding this talent<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>: But
the Son of God spake with other views, and
to nobler purposes; and his inspired historians
would not have condescended to make the
panegyric of their Master, from so trivial a
distinction.</p>

<p>Let us see, then, to what the encomium of
the text amounts; and what those <small>CIRCUMSTANCES</small>
are, in the discourses of Jesus, which
give real weight and dignity to the observation—<i>that
never man spake like this man</i>.</p>

<p>This will be an inquiry of use, and not of
curiosity only; we shall find, in the course of
it, very much to confirm our faith, as well as
to excite our admiration.</p>

<p>I. The first particular, that strikes an attentive
mind in considering the discourses of
Jesus, is the <small>MATTER</small> of them; the most important;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
and, at the same time, the most
extraordinary; of the utmost consequence to
mankind, and the most remote from all their
natural apprehensions.</p>

<p>But, by the discourses of Jesus, so qualified,
I mean chiefly those, which are truly his own,
and properly <i>Christian</i>: such as acquaint us
with the dignity of his person, and nature of
his office; with the purpose of his mission,
and the manner in which that purpose was to
be effected.</p>

<p>His moral discourses, though they be divine
too, yet, being intended, for the most part, to
deliver the religion of nature, or the religion of
Moses, in all its purity, may be thought to
contain nothing more than what human reason
had, or might have discovered, or what the
Law of God, at least, had already revealed.
Yet it may deserve to be mentioned as an argument
of his superiority to all other moral
instructors, that <span class="smcap">He only</span> has delivered a
doctrine of life and manners, free from all
mixture of error, and carried in some instances
to a degree of perfection which, I do not say
Reason, but, no Doctor of reason ever prescribed;
and that he penetrated further into the
true meaning of the Jewish Law, than any of
its expositors had ever done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>But, as I said, I confine myself to his <i>peculiar
doctrines</i>, such as constitute the substance
of that religion, which we properly call
Christian.</p>

<p>And here, the weight of his doctrine must
be felt by those persons who reflect that,
coming into a world overrun with vice and
misery, he proclaimed pardon and peace in
this life, and everlasting happiness and glory
in the life to come, to all who with penitent
hearts and true faith turned to him. What
Doctor, Philosopher, or Legislator <i>ever spake
as He spake</i>, on these important articles?
What had Nature taught the Gentile world?
Some fine lessons of morality, indeed, which
might direct their lives for the future; but
none that could set their minds at ease from
past guilt, none that could free their consciences
from instinctive terror, much less
could erect their hopes to any assured prospect
of immortality. What had Moses taught the
Jews? A divine religion, it is true, but such
as left them under the burthen of a painful and
oppressive ritual, in which the neglect of any
one precept, or the irregular performance of
any, might shake their security; and of which,
when punctually observed, the reward was
only some present ease or convenience in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
world. What was there in either institution,
that could deliver men from all doubt and uncertainty
about their future condition, or that
could disarm and appease the universal guilt of
mankind?</p>

<p>Let this then admonish us of what, from its
familiarity, we are, now, so prone to forget,
the importance, which characterized the doctrine
of Jesus.</p>

<p>The <i>extraordinary nature</i> of it equally appears;
but will further and chiefly be seen, if
we attend to the means, by which this supreme
blessing is said to be conveyed, and effected.</p>

<p>That a divine person, divine in the highest
sense of the word, should descend from heaven
and take our nature upon him; <i>the Heir of
all things</i><a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> should be content to appear <i>in the
form of a servant</i><a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>; and, having <i>life in himself</i><a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>,
should chuse to suffer death; that, by
this astonishing humiliation, he should propose
to effect an end, equally astonishing, The salvation
of a ruined world; that, being without
sin himself, he should offer himself a sacrifice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
for sin; that in virtue of his all-atoning
death, he should undertake to abolish death,
and open the gates of eternal life to the whole
race of mortal man; that, in this way, he
should assume to be our <i>Wisdom and Righteousness</i>,
our <i>Sanctification and Redemption</i><a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>;
These are the great things of which Christ
<i>spake</i>; these the amazing topics with which he
filled his discourses. And must we not conclude,
that <i>he spake as never man spake</i>? I
do not, at present, urge the accomplishment
of all these wonders. That is a distinct consideration.
But it must be allowed, that he
<i>spake</i> in this tone, and to this effect. And did
ever any man before him utter such things?
Did it ever enter into the heart of man to conceive
such things? which surely are enough
to arrest our attention; to turn our thoughts on
the evidence, with which they are accompanied;
and, till we admit the force of that evidence,
to convince us, at least, that such a speaker
as this, is eminently distinguished from all
other speakers, that ever addressed themselves
to mankind. He discovered, on other occasions,
no defect of mind, or temper; nothing,
that should lead us to suspect him of weakness,
or enthusiasm; And when such a person so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
speaks, the sublime and extraordinary nature
of his doctrine is no small presumption of its
truth.</p>

<p>II. Another circumstance that distinguishes
the discourses of Jesus, is the <small>AUTHORITY</small>, with
which they were delivered. The people themselves
remarked this circumstance, and were
astonished at it; <i>for he taught them</i>, says the
sacred historian, <i>as one who had authority,
and not as the Scribes</i><a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.</p>

<p>Interpreters differ in explaining what this
<i>authority</i> was; but it consisted, very clearly,
in these three things. 1. He taught mankind
without any degree of doubt and hesitation,
with the air of one who knew the truth of what
he said, and was perfectly assured of all he
spake. <i>Verily, verily, I say to thee, we
speak that we do know, and testify that we
have seen<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.</i> 2. He taught his great lessons of
morality and religion, not as derived from the
information of others, or from the dictates of
his own reason, but as immediately conveyed
to him from the source of light and truth, from
God himself. <i>Whatsoever I speak, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
as the Father said to me, so I</i> speak<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. 3. Lastly,
He delivered his doctrine on very many occasions,
as the proper author of it, as one who
had a right to propose the terms of Salvation,
in his own name. I <i>say unto You</i>—is the
formulary, with which he prefaces his momentous
instructions. <i>He that believeth on
the Son, hath everlasting life, and</i> I <i>will raise
him up at the last day</i><a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. <i>Be thou faithful
unto death, and</i> I <i>will give thee a crown of
life</i><a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. Nay, he goes so far as to assert expressly,
<i>that he hath life in himself, even as
the Father hath life in himself</i><a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. And though
he says, at the same time, that he had this
privilege given him by the Father, and though
he declares, elsewhere, that as the <i>Father had
taught him, so he spake</i><a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>; yet there is no
contradiction in these affirmations; for he tells
us expressly—<i>All things that the Father
hath, are mine</i><a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>; <i>And I and the Father are
one</i><a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.</p>

<p>These three circumstances, taken together,
constitute the proper authority of Christ’s doctrine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
It was the authority of one, who spake
from conviction; who spake by the special
appointment of God the Father, who even
spake, by virtue of his own essential right,
from himself, and in his own name.</p>

<p>Compare, now, this <i>authoritative</i> way of
speaking, with that of the Jewish scribes; who
explained their Law, as they could, by the
precarious traditions of their forefathers, and
the uncertain glosses of their celebrated Doctors:
Compare it with that of the Gentile
Philosophers; who quibbled, by the help of a
little logick or metaphysicks, on the nature of
God and the Soul; who advanced their doctrines
of futurity, on the credit of an old fable, or an
old song; and even delivered their moral lectures
on the weak grounds of their fanciful or
discordant systems; in the way of negligent
speculation, or, which was worse, of altercation
and dispute: Compare it, lastly, with that of
all others, who, in antient or modern times,
have taken upon themselves to instruct mankind;
and see, if any of these ever assumed
the exalted tone, or spake with the <i>authority</i>
of Jesus, of <i>the Carpenter’s Son</i>, as Julian
and the followers of that school affect to call
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>But high pretensions, you will say, prove
nothing. Not much, indeed, when destitute
of their proper supports; yet so much, as to
verify the observation of the text—<i>that never
man spake like this man</i>. And if they prove
thus much, they prove more; the necessity,
or reasonableness, at least, of examining whether
these pretensions be well founded. For
claims of so extraordinary a nature, as they
must needs awaken our curiosity, so they may
demand our belief. When a voice speaks, as
from heaven, it naturally turns our attention
to that quarter; and, when it speaks in <i>inimitable
thunder</i><a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>, it speaks, methinks, like
itself, and in accents that cannot well be misunderstood.</p>

<p>But our next observation will carry us further.
For I make it</p>

<p>III. A third circumstance, in the character
of Christ’s <i>speaking</i>, that he expressed himself
with more than mortal WISDOM, on many occasions,
when the malice and captious subtlety
of his enemies put that wisdom to its utmost
test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>He gave early proofs of his wisdom, when,
at the age of twelve years, he reasoned with
the Doctors in the temple, to such effect, <i>that
all who heared him, were astonished at his understanding
and answers</i><a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.</p>

<p>These answers, indeed, are not recorded;
but many others are, in the course of his
ministry; answers to nice, insidious, and concerted
questions of the ablest men among the
Jews, in critical circumstances, and on the
most trying emergencies. And to these questions
he always replied with a presence of mind
so unshaken, with a judgment so infallible,
with a dexterity and prudence so conciliating,
and at the same time with an integrity so pure
and perfect, that no advantage could in any
degree be taken against him. His adversaries
came again and again to the charge; whom
yet he repelled with so triumphant a superiority
over all the efforts of their wit and malice, that
he forced them in the end, <i>to marvel and hold
their peace</i><a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. His divine responses came out
so contrary to their hopes and their interests,
that they were discouraged and deterred from
provoking any more of them—<i>they durst not
ask him any more questions</i><a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>The limits of this discourse will not give
room for a detailed account of these questions
and answers. But they are thick sown in the
Gospels: And ye will understand me to point
more especially at those, that respected his
divine character, and kingly office<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>; in which
conversations the danger was, lest he should
drop something that might be made a handle
against him before the Jewish Consistory, or
the Roman Tribunals; while yet he was not
to betray his cause, or bely his pretensions.
The danger was instant, and, if he had fallen
under it, must have been fatal. For, in withdrawing
his claim of being the Messiah, the
<i>King of Israel</i>, he must have owned himself
an impostor; in asserting it, at this time,
clearly and openly, he would have given his
enemies a pretence for treating him, as a criminal
of state; an imputation which could not
consist with the truth or dignity of his mission.
He came into the world to suffer death, indeed;
but not as convicted of any crime, not
as colourably condemned by any legal sentence.
His innocence was to be conspicuous, and his
honour unimpaired<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>In this respect, then, it seems, as if it might
be truly affirmed, that <i>never man spake as this
man</i>. And, if this much must be allowed, we
are, methinks, but a little way from a further
conclusion, <i>That, therefore, he spake by a
divine spirit</i>.</p>

<p>If it be said, that this conclusion does not
hold, <i>for that the same faculties of the human
mind, which make us capable of</i> <small>SEEING</small> <i>this
wisdom, may have</i> <small>PRODUCED</small> <i>it</i>, the ground
of the observation is neither likely, nor true.
Not likely in the present instance, where the
wisdom in question appears to be exquisite and
constant: qualities which we are not accustomed
to find united in the efforts of human wisdom.
But neither, in general, is the position true:
For then, the power of perception and invention
would be the same; then, the divine intellect
would be levelled with the human; then,
the wisdom of God himself, so far as it was
acknowledged and understood by us, would be
our wisdom. Whereas, common sense tells
us, that to discover a truth and to apprehend
it, to project a measure, and to conceive the
fitness of it, are two things<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>: And, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
men differ widely in their capacities from each
other, yet there is a capacity, which no man
may claim, as there is a wisdom, to which no
man pretends. The sublime views of God in
the system of nature are comprehended, to a
certain degree, and justly magnified and unfolded
by many men, who, yet, have not the
presumption to suppose that they were themselves
capable, of planning such a system. In like
manner, we may see and adore the wisdom,
with which Christ <i>spake</i>, and yet conclude,
upon good grounds, that as no man ever
did, so no man ever could, speak with such
wisdom.</p>

<p>IV. A fourth circumstance (and the last I
shall mention) which distinguished Jesus, as a
Speaker, was the penetrating influence of his
discourses, or the divine <small>ENERGY</small>, with which
they were accompanied.</p>

<p>Other speakers have thought it enough to
convince their hearers by cogent arguments;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
to excite their passions by lively images; to
touch the general springs of humanity, or to
practise on the peculiar foibles and prejudices
of the party addressed. But Jesus had the
singular art to convince without reasoning, and
to persuade without rhetorick. Few and simple
words, from that mouth, attained their end
with ease: they struck the soul with more
than all the effect of that eloquence, which
hath been compared to lightning: they needed
no help from tropes and figures, from the acquired
knowledge of human nature, or from
the information of others, but went directly to
the heart by their own proper and irresistible
virtue. In a word, Jesus saw what no art
could divine, he saw intuitively the naked conscience,
the secret individual thoughts of those,
with whom he had any concern; and being
able, withal, to possess their minds with a
consciousness of this intuition, his least word,
his look, nay his silence must needs <i>speak</i> beyond
the eloquence of other men.</p>

<p>There are many instances of this sort, recorded
in the Gospels. He saw the malice of
the Scribes and Pharisees<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, while it was yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
latent in the heart, and only forming itself into
secret purposes and mental propositions; and
he surprized them by his answers, into shame
and <i>madness</i><a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. He saw the seeds of ambition
putting forth in the minds of his disciples:
and by a word or two, he prevented the growth
of them<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. By only <i>looking</i> upon Peter<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>, he
struck him into remorse and tears. And by
<i>answering nothing</i>, he <i>astonished</i>, at once,
and convinced the Roman Governor, who sat
in judgment upon him<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>.</p>

<p>This inspection of the heart, was that which
confounded the officers, whom the chief priests
had sent to apprehend him, and drew from
them, on their return, the advantageous report
of the text—<i>that never man spake like this
man</i>. For, by what he said in their hearing,
he gave them to understand that he knew their
commission before they had opened it: and so
disarmed their rage, by only signifying his
acquaintance with their design.</p>

<p>The effect of what he said and did was, in
many conjunctures, wholly disproportioned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
his words and actions: and is only to be accounted
for, from the clear insight he had into
the mind, and from the secret influence which
he knew, by an apt sentence<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>, or by an expressive
emblem<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>, to inject into the conscience
of his hearers. And what resistance can, indeed,
be made to such a <i>speaker</i>, who hath
the hearts of men in his hands, and <i>turneth
them whithersoever he will</i><a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>?</p>

<p>In all views, then, whether we consider the
<i>matter</i>, the <i>authority</i>, the <i>wisdom</i>, or the <i>effect</i>
of Christ’s discourses, we must needs be
convinced that the text is amply verified, and
that <i>never man spake like this man</i>.</p>

<p>To conclude: I have not amused you, in
this discourse, with vain declamation. I am
not solicitous to establish the credit of Jesus,
as a consummate orator. My views are other
and far higher. I would convince you, by a
reference to plain facts, that he was more than
man; that he spake by the unerring spirit of
God; that his word demands not your praise,
but your adoration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<p>If men would take their ideas of this divine
teacher immediately from his own doctrines,
and not as they are misrepresented, or at best
imperfectly represented by the glosses of
others, they would come, of themselves, to
this important conclusion: if they would make
the Gospel their serious study, and not their
casual amusement, they would want no monitor
to let them into the merits, or the use
of it. They would more than see, they
would feel the spirit, with which Jesus
spake; and they would readily offer to him,
not their barren applause, but their sincere
obedience.</p>

<p>Till this salutary effect be wrought in those
who call themselves the disciples of Jesus,
it may not be improper to remind them of
what he himself said to <small>ONE</small>, who was affected,
as we may now be, by a sense of his
divine power in speaking. He had been delivering
great truths, with that authority
and wisdom, which ever accompanied his
instructions, and the effect was answerable.
For <i>it came to pass</i>, as he <i>spake these things,
that a certain woman of the company lifted
up her voice, and said to him</i>, in the customary
style of approbation, <i>Blessed is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
womb that bare thee, and the paps that thou
hast sucked. But</i> <small>HE</small> <i>said, Yea, rather blessed
are they that</i> <small>HEAR THE WORD OF GOD, AND
KEEP IT</small><a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.</p>

<span class="medium">PREACHED NOVEMBER 20, 1774.</span></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Matth.</span> xiii. 10.</h3>

<p><i>The Disciples came, and said unto him, Why
speakest Thou to them in Parables?</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Two</span> things are very observable in our Lord’s
conduct towards the Jews. He came to <i>instruct</i>
them in the principles of a new religion,
and to <i>convince</i> them of its divine authority.
Yet to such of them, as were least enlightened
by his doctrine, he generally addressed himself
in Parables: And before such, as were backward
to admit his pretensions, he was sparing
of his Miracles. Now the contrary of this conduct,
it is said, might be expected: That he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
should have explained himself in the clearest
manner to the uninformed Jews; and should
have multiplied his miracles, for the conviction
of the unbelieving.</p>

<p>I propose to consider both these circumstances
in the history of Jesus; and to shew
that his conduct, in either case, was suitable
to his character and mission.</p>

<p>I, now, confine myself to the <small>PARABLES</small>;
and shall take another occasion to consider the
<small>MIRACLES</small>.</p>

<p>The Disciples, having observed that their
Master spoke to the Jews in a more obscure
and indirect manner, than he was wont to do
in private to themselves, <i>came and said unto
him, Why speakest thou to them in Parables?</i></p>

<p>This method of conveying instruction in Parables,
that is, in some feigned story, where
one thing is put for another, and in which the
circumstances of the story are to be applied to
something different in the intention of the
speaker, is well known to have been of constant
and familiar use in the old world, and
especially in the Eastern nations. This figurative
cast of language had its rise from necessity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
the rude conceptions of men requiring general
truths to be presented to them, in sensible
images. But it soon came to be affected as an
ornamental way of speaking or writing, the
liveliness of the image awakening curiosity,
and affording amusement to the mind. Lastly,
it was sometimes employed as a mysterious
cover of important truths, to which a more
than ordinary attention was to be raised, and
especially of such important truths as could
not be communicated openly and directly without
offence. Under this last idea, the Parable,
properly so called, presents itself to us. It
was contrived on purpose to throw some degree
of obscurity over the information, it contained:
And it is in reference to this use and character
of the Parable, that the Disciples ask why
Jesus thought fit to address the Jews in this
way.</p>

<p>To this question, why he spake to the Jews
in Parables, and not to the Disciples, our
Lord’s reply is in these words—<i>Because, to
you it is given to know the mysteries of the
kingdom of God, but to them it is not given</i>.</p>

<p>By this answer we learn, <i>First</i>, that the
things delivered by him in this obscure way
were not the fundamental truths of the Gospel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
but <i>the mysteries of the kingdom of God</i>, that
is, certain secrets relating to the progress of
the Gospel, and the event of it in the world;
a consideration, which will be enlarged upon
in its place: And, <i>Secondly</i>, that it was not
<i>given</i> to the Jews, at large, to be let into those
mysteries, but to the disciples only.</p>

<p>But why <i>not given to the Jews</i>? why was
it thought less fit for them, to be initiated in
these mysteries, than for the Disciples? Our
Lord condescends to answer, or rather to anticipate
this question, likewise—<i>For whosoever
hath, to him shall be given and he shall have
more abundance; but whosoever hath not,
from him shall be taken away even that he
hath</i>.</p>

<p>The answer, we see, is formed on this general
principle, “That information in the councils
of God is not to be claimed as a debt; but
accepted as a reward: that he, who hath acquired
some knowledge and improved what he
hath, deserves a further communication of it;
but that he, who hath been at no pains to acquire
any, or who puts his knowledge to as
little use, as if he had acquired none, is so far
from having a right to more, that he even deserves
to have the pittance, he may already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
possess, taken from him.” And what more indisputable
rule of reason, than this, That, in a
matter of pure favour, we should deserve, by
our good dispositions at least, this distinction
before we obtain it. So that the answer comes
out thus—“I speak to the <small>JEWS</small> in parables,
because they do not deserve, by the pains they
have hitherto taken to learn of me, and by the
dispositions they have shewn to improve what
I have taught them, to have further information
plainly and openly conveyed to them: But
to <small>YOU</small>, who have already profited by my doctrine,
and are disposed still further to profit by
it, to you I address myself in a plainer manner,
because ye deserve to be more fully and abundantly
instructed by me.” And to this answer,
thus understood, what objection, or even what
cavil, can be opposed?</p>

<p>But, further, when Jesus said to his Disciples,
that <i>to them it was given to know the
mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the
Jews</i>, at large, <i>it was not given</i>, this determination
must be understood as founded, not
merely on the fitness of the thing, as here explained,
but on the positive will and declared
purpose of God. This appears from what follows.
For <i>therefore</i>, proceeds our Lord,
<i>speak I to them in Parables, because they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
seeing see not, and hearing they hear not,
neither do they understand. And in them is
fulfilled the prophecy of Isaias, which saith,
by hearing Ye shall hear and shall not understand,
and seeing Ye shall see and shall not
perceive. For this people’s heart is waxed
gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and
their eyes they have closed, lest at any time
they should see with their eyes, and hear with
their ears, and should understand with their
hearts, and should be converted, and I should
heal them.</i></p>

<p>Hence it appears, that the way of speaking
in Parables, which Jesus employed towards the
Jews, was that which the word of prophecy
had declared he should employ towards them.
So that this was one, among others, of the
marks, by which the Messiah should be known
and distinguished. <i>To speak in Parables</i>,
was a part of his office: It was a duty imposed
upon him, in his very commission.</p>

<p>But this, you will say, is only removing the
difficulty one step backwards, and transferring
it from the Gospel upon the Law; And you
still ask, upon what reasons this strange way of
proceeding with the Jews, thus foretold and
enjoined, was founded?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>Now, though it becomes us with much reverence
to inquire into the reasons of God’s
dispensations, yet as we see, in fact, that it
was God’s will to treat the Jews in this manner,
we may be allowed to indulge some conjectures
on the subject; And, as we have
traced this difficulty up to its source, this will
be the proper place to attempt a more full solution
of it.</p>

<p>To make way for this solution, let it be observed,
that there are two ways in which this
famous prophecy of Isaiah may be regarded by
us; either, first, as <i>a mere prediction of the
event</i>, namely, that by this way of speaking to
them in Parables, the Jews <i>would</i> not be converted;
Or, secondly, <i>as a judicial determination
of it</i>, namely, that this obscure way of
teaching was therefore employed, because it
was in the divine councils that they <i>should</i> not
be converted. In either way of considering the
Prophecy, this mysterious conduct may, I
think, be cleared up.</p>

<p>If we consider the <i>event</i> only, as pointed
out by this Prophecy, then the reason, which
Jesus himself gives of this conduct, and which
has been before explained, namely the general
fitness of such a procedure in itself, is a satisfactory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
account of it. For what more just than
to leave men to the consequences of their own
behaviour, and not to reward them with that
which they neither desire nor deserve?</p>

<p>But, perhaps, the event was not simply predicted
of the Jews, but <i>determined</i> upon them<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.
And there may be reason to take the prophecy,
the rather, in this light, because however fit
such a conduct, as it describes, may be in itself,
yet, in fact, it was not observed towards
the Gentiles, nor even the Jews after the descent
of the holy Ghost; the Apostles not addressing
either in the way of Parables, as our
Lord had done the unbelieving Jews: and this
agreeably to their Master’s express injunctions
to them—<i>for there is nothing covered that
shall not be revealed, and hid that shall not be
known; What I tell you in darkness that
speak ye in the light, and what ye hear in the
ear that preach ye upon the house-tops</i><a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>. This
different conduct may then lead us to suspect
that there was something peculiar in the situation
of those Jews, to whom Jesus addressed
his Parables, which this prophecy respected;
and that it was God’s purpose, in the case of
such of them as should stand out against this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
so long abused mode of information, when proceeding
from the mouth of the Messiah himself,
to leave them under a judicial blindness. And
supposing this to be the case, the conduct (as
severe as it seems) may be justified by the following
considerations.</p>

<p>1. All the notices, which it had pleased God
to give to the ancient Jews of the Gospel dispensation,
were conveyed in this way of Parable.
The terms, employed in the old prophecies,
were all taken from the Law, but the
true meaning lay deeper, and the right application
of those prophecies was to the Christian
Covenant, and to the character and dispensation
of the Messiah. This method of predicting the
Gospel under legal ideas, was employed for the
wisest reasons<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>: The Jews had been constantly
trained and brought up in it; and, notwithstanding
the real obscurity this mode of teaching
was intended to have, yet with fair attentive
minds they might easily have apprehended
the true drift and purpose of it. The Prophets
call upon them perpetually to give this attention:
they even drop frequent hints, that
might lead them to the discovery: and, upon occasion,
do every thing but expound in direct
terms, their own parables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>What now was the effect of all this intelligence,
so gradually, so repeatedly, so solicitously,
as it were, imparted to them? Why,
they would not hear, nor understand: they
perversely and obstinately rested in the cover
of these predictions; would look for nothing
beneath or beyond it, indulged their prejudices
about the eternity of their law, and the temporal
power of their expected Deliverer, so far, that,
when at length their Deliverer came, for whom
this chain of prophetic instruction was meant
to prepare them, they did not and would not
acknowledge him. For this gross neglect of a
mode of information, so long and so mercifully
indulged to them, God thought fit to punish
them by the very instrument of their offence.
He commissioned Jesus still to continue that
way of Parables, which they had so outrageously
abused; and so, in his justice, <i>made it
the occasion of blinding their eyes and hardening
their hearts</i><a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>, to their final rejection and
reprobation.</p>

<p>This seems to be the true state of the case:
and what has Reason to object to it? Can any
thing be more just, than that a much abused
mercy should end in punishment? And can
any thing be more fit, than that such punishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
should be the forfeiture of that blessing, which
the mercy was intended to convey, and should
even be inflicted by the very means of that
mercy<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>? What is there in this œconomy of
God’s religious dispensations, which contradicts
our ideas of the divine attributes? Nay, what
is there in it, which does not accord to the
known methods of his ordinary and moral government
of the world? Health and Prosperity,
Parts and Learning, are the merciful gifts
of God to some men. To these mercies,
rightly improved, certain blessings are, in the
order of his providence, annexed. Yet how
often do we see men deprived of the blessings,
for their misuse of those mercies, and deprived
by means of the very mercies themselves! The
mercies are a snare to them; and in the way of
natural punishment inflict those evils, which
they were intended to prevent. Thus, health
and prosperity, ill employed, bring on a diseased
old age, and an uncomfortable enjoyment
of life; and parts and learning, so fitted to
produce true knowledge, are the means by
which many are led into presumption and
mistake.</p>

<p>And in this way, we easily conceive how
justly the Jews were punished, in their rejection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
of the Messiah, for their wilful abuse and misinterpretation
of the Scripture Prophesies concerning
him; and how fitly the punishment
was conveyed by Christ’s <i>speaking to them in
Parables</i>, that is, by that mode of instruction
by that very instrument of mercy, which they
had so much abused.</p>

<p>But though this perverseness of the Jews
may be reasonably thought judicial, yet even
<i>in his Judgments God remembers mercy</i>. Let
it therefore be considered</p>

<p>2. In the second place, that, though Christ’s
speaking to the Jews in Parables did eventually
harden their hearts, yet not more so, perhaps
not so much as the open communication of
truth would have done.</p>

<p>I before took notice, that the subject of
Christ’s parables was not the fundamental tenets
of the Gospel, but <i>the mysteries of the kingdom
of God</i>. This we know from the mouth of
Christ himself; and it deserves to be considered.
That Jesus was the Messiah, that all men
were to believe in him, and to be saved by him,
these great fundamental articles of his religion,
together with his moral doctrine, were published
plainly to all; and the evidences of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
Messiahship, as resulting from his miracles and
an appeal to their own prophecies, were in no
sense concealed from the Jews. So that, in
truth, the light afforded to them was by no
means so penurious, or so darkly conveyed, as
the objection supposes. What was kept back
from them and thrown into the shade, was only or
chiefly, the future fortunes of the Gospel, called
<i>the Mysteries of God’s kingdom</i>; of which the
rejection of the Jews, and the call of the Gentiles,
were principal. These Christ delivered
to the Jews in parables, <i>and without a parable
spake he not</i> on these subjects, <i>unto them</i>.
Now, though it be true that, had people
penetrated these mysteries, they might, by a
right use of this knowledge, have been led to a
just apprehension of many of their own prophecies,
and, in the end, to an acknowledgement
of the Christian faith; yet ’tis likely, considering
their inveterate prejudices, that the clear
delivery of these momentous truths would have
had no such effect; nay, that their aversion to
the faith of Jesus might have been increased by
having this offensive information plainly and
nakedly presented to them.</p>

<p>And there will seem to be more weight
in this conjecture, if we reflect that even to the
Apostles themselves, till after his resurrection,
our Lord proceeded with much caution in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
unfolding <i>the mysteries of his kingdom. Then</i>,
indeed, <i>he opened their understandings<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>; and,
beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he
expounded unto them, in all the Scriptures,
the things concerning himself</i><a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. But before
that event had taken place, so much light only
was let in upon the minds of the Disciples, as
they were <i>able to bear</i><a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>: the <i>parables</i> were in
some measure explained to them; yet a certain
degree of obscurity was still left on the explanation
itself.</p>

<p>From which conduct of their great Master,
apparently assumed by him in consideration of
their infirmities, it seems reasonable to conclude,
That his greater reserve towards the
rest of the Jews, in speaking to them in <i>unexplained</i>
parables, was, among other reasons,
therefore chosen by him, because it was best
adapted to their prejudices, and even gave them
the fairest chance for apprehending and embracing
his doctrine. But</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, and lastly, what if we suppose
(as we have the highest reason to do, after the
trials, which had been already made of them)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
that no evidence whatsoever, not the clearest
possible information, would, under any management,
have had its due effect on the unbelieving
Jews? In this view of things, the proposing
of these mysteries under the impenetrable
cover of Parables was the greatest of all
mercies to them, since a further degree of light
would not only have indisposed them to the reception
of it, but must have aggravated their
guilt beyond measure, and have left them
totally without excuse. To <i>blind their eyes
and harden their hearts</i> was then a <i>judgment</i>,
if you will, but surely a judgment in <i>mercy</i>, if
ever there was any such thing; a punishment
inflicted upon them in the most tender and
compassionate manner, which goodness itself
could contrive, or which their deplorable circumstances
could admit.</p>

<p>These things being considered, To the
question, <i>Why did Jesus speak to the unbelieving
Jews in parables</i>, we may now reply,
<i>first</i>, That this conduct was reasonable in itself,
on that general principle of <small>EQUITY</small>, <i>that
he only, who hath, shall receive more abundantly</i>:
That, <i>secondly</i>, the <small>JUSTICE</small> of God
was fitly exercised upon them for their refusing
to be instructed by him in the way of Parable,
and by the very medium of Parable, so abused:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
That still, <i>thirdly</i>, this parabolical method of
instruction was, in all probability, better adapted
to their circumstances, and more <small>LIKELY</small>
to be effectual, than a plainer communication:
And that, <i>lastly</i>, supposing it <small>CERTAIN</small>
that no information whatever would have taken
effect, this obscure and inefficient one of parables
served, at least, as some excuse for their
obstinacy, and was contrived, in mercy, to alleviate
their guilt.</p>

<p>The result of the whole, is, That we are
hence taught to adore the awful ways of God’s
providence, in this instance of <i>Christ’s speaking
in parables</i>; in which both his Justice and
Goodness are so equally and signally displayed.</p>

<p><i>And he did not many mighty works there,
because of their unbelief.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> were two things, I observed, very
remarkable in the conduct of our blessed
Saviour towards the Jews. One was, that
he chose to instruct the more ignorant and
uninformed of them, in the obscure way of
<i>parable</i>: The other, that he wrought but <i>few
miracles</i> for the conviction of such of them as
were incredulous and unbelieving.</p>

<p>These two circumstances may be thought
strange; because the less informed the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
were to whom he addressed himself, the more
need there seems to have been of the <i>plainest
instruction</i>; and the less disposed they were
to believe in him, the greater necessity we may
think there was for subduing their unbelief by
<i>the force of miracles</i>. Yet the conduct of
Jesus was not according to these expectations,
in either instance; and has accordingly furnished
the occasion of <small>TWO</small> corresponding objections
to his divine character and mission.</p>

<p>To the <i>former</i> of these objections, that
which respects his <i>way of speaking by parables</i>,
I have already replied in a distinct discourse
on that subject. The <i>latter</i>, which
respects his <i>way of working miracles</i>, I now
propose to consider.</p>

<p>The text, you see, points out the subject,
and confines me to it. Jesus, in discharge of
his general office, and from a principle, as we
may suppose, of private affection, <i>went into
his own country</i>, that is, to Nazareth, where
he had been brought up, with the intention of
preaching the Gospel there, and of giving the
people of that place the proper proofs of his
authority and mission. Accordingly, the sacred
historian tells us, <i>he taught them in their
synagogue</i>; And we know, besides, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
wrought some miracles; for the people were
astonished and said, <i>Whence hath this man
this</i> <small>WISDOM</small>, and these <small>MIGHTY WORKS</small>?</p>

<p>They were the more astonished, because
Jesus was no stranger to them; and the rest
of his family, people of an obscure condition,
then lived among them. They knew him only
under the idea of a <i>Carpenter’s Son</i>, and they
had observed perhaps nothing extraordinary
him; or, if they had, this very circumstance,
as is not uncommon among neighbours and
countrymen, might have infused some jealousy
and dislike of him. Be that as it will, their
prejudices against him were extreme, and they
expressed them in the most contemptuous
manner. <i>Is not this</i>, say they, <i>the Carpenter’s
Son? Is not his Mother called
Mary? and his Brethren, James, and Joses,
and Simon, and Judas? And his Sisters,
are they not all with us? Whence then hath
this man all these things? And they were
offended in him.</i> To these disparaging questions,
which easily overpowered the evidence
of conviction even from their own senses,
Jesus only replied, <i>A prophet is not without
honour, save in his own country, and in his
own house</i>. And then the text follows, which
says, <i>And he did not many mighty works
there, because of their unbelief</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>This is the <small>FACT</small>: And the question upon it,
is, <i>Why Jesus forebore to work miracles
among these people, because they did not believe
in him?</i></p>

<p>Before I reply distinctly to this question,
permit me to premise <i>two</i> general observations;
one, on the use of miracles, considered
in themselves; and the other, on the use of
miracles, as applied to the Christian dispensation.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, then, I observe, that, a miracle being,
for the time, an alteration or suspension of the
laws of nature, our best ideas of the divine attributes
lead us to conclude, that this violence
on his own plan of government is only exerted
for some very important end, and will be exerted
no farther, nor oftener, than is necessary
to that end. It is true, it may be difficult for
us to judge, in many cases, of that importance,
and of that necessity; but unless both be very
apparent to us, in no case, can we be authorized
to require or even expect, a continuance
or repetition, much less a multiplication of
these miraculous exertions. To judge otherwise
on this subject, would be to charge God
foolishly, and, in effect, to blaspheme his
wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, I observe, that the use of miracles,
as applied to the Christian dispensation, is to
give credit to the character and pretensions of
Jesus. It is supposed in this argument that
miracles, duly circumstanced and fully attested,
are sufficient to this purpose; but there
is no reason to suppose that more or greater
will be wrought, than that purpose requires.</p>

<p>These things being premised, to the question,
<i>Why Jesus did not many miracles, before
the unbelieving Jews of Nazareth</i>, I
reply directly by saying</p>

<p>I. In the first place, <i>because such a display
of his power was not necessary to their conviction</i>.
I mean not to say at present, that
more or greater miracles would not have convinced
them (though it be very unlikely, that
they would), but that they were not necessary
to the end proposed by them, which was to
afford such an attestation to the character of
Jesus as might be a reasonable and, in itself,
a sufficient ground of their conviction. More
than this the Jews had no right to expect.
And less than this was not offered: For when
it is said, that Jesus did not <i>many</i> miracles at
Nazareth, it is implied that he did <i>some</i>; and
thus much they confess themselves in asking,
<i>whence hath this man these mighty works?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

<p>Now <i>some</i> miracles, nay <i>one single</i> miracle,
seen and confessed as such, was a reasonable
ground of conviction. More therefore could
not be esteemed <i>necessary</i>, that is, were not
required to furnish the fit and proper means of
such conviction. Without doubt, God, if he
had been so pleased, might have shattered and
confounded all the elements, and have driven
the men of Nazareth, and even the Jewish
Sanhedrim itself, by the force and terror of his
almighty power, into an unwilling acknowledgment
of his Son, Jesus. But this is not
the way in which he treats his reasonable creatures,
even when he exceeds the ordinary methods
of his providence. He does that which
is simply fit and right, in respect of the end he
has in view, and leaves the rest to ourselves.
This, as far as we know, is the universal mode
of God’s government, and as far as we can
judge, is the most worthy of him.</p>

<p>Still, it will be said, though Jesus was not
obliged to do more for the conviction of these
unbelievers, though more or greater miracles
could not strictly be required of him, yet so
limited a display of his power on such an occasion
seemed penurious, and even unkind.
A little more zeal, and some supernumerary
wonders, might have better expressed his concern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
for his unhappy countrymen. I reply
then,</p>

<p>II. In the second place, that as more or
greater miracles were not necessary to the end
of giving a just proof of his mission, so they
were most probably not expedient to any other
good end, but, on the contrary, would have
been hurtful and pernicious to his unbelieving
countrymen.</p>

<p>We have reason to conclude thus, if we
consider that the same prejudices, which obstructed
their conviction from <i>some</i> confessed
miracles, would not have given way to <i>more</i>.
We have an example in the other unbelieving
Jews, especially in the rulers of that people,
who, the more and greater miracles they saw
performed by Jesus, were the more hardened
in their unbelief, and the more exasperated
against him. They even give it as a reason
for their vindictive prosecution of him, that he
<i>did</i>, and <i>was doing many miracles</i><a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.</p>

<p>Taking the matter then in this light, what
other effect could a waste of miracles have had,
but to heap guilt and vengeance upon their
heads? By leaving these perverse people to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
themselves, perhaps their prejudices might
subside, and they might yield in time to the
evidence they already had, or they might
submit to other evidence, which they should
collect for themselves hereafter. To have irritated
their prejudices, now, by further miracles,
might have fixed them absolutely in unbelief.</p>

<p>This conclusion becomes the more probable,
if we admit the pretensions of Jesus: For
then he may be supposed to have certainly
foreseen the present impracticability of converting
these men, and to have restrained his
power before them, on that account. But I
am now arguing with those, who make this
conduct an objection to his pretensions. I
offer it therefore as a conclusion only very probable
from the nature of the thing, that his
<i>not doing many miracles</i> before his unbelieving
countrymen, was, among other motives, from
<i>a principle of mercy and kindness to them</i>.
At least, the contrary, I think, cannot be affirmed
with any shew or colour of reason.</p>

<p>But whatever kindness our Lord might
have for these men, his continuing to work
more miracles among them, under the present
circumstances, would have been improper,
because</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>III. In the next place (and this is my <i>third</i>
answer to the objection) <i>this conduct would
have opposed, and tended directly to defeat,
the general end and success of his ministry</i>.</p>

<p>The proper <small>END</small> of his ministry was to
preach salvation to the Jews, and to give them
such evidence of his being the Messiah, as was
sufficient to their conviction. When he had
done this in one place, if no very important
considerations induced his longer stay, he was
to proceed to another. This was so essential a
part of his office, that it seems not to have
been forgotten, even when there was no peculiar
complaint of <i>unbelief</i>, in those with whom
he had resided. For when the people of another
place, of more <i>faith</i>, as it should seem,
<i>came to him, and</i> would have <i>stayed him, that
he should not depart from them</i>, He refused
to comply with them, and <i>said, I must
preach the kingdom of God to other cities
also, for</i> <small>THEREFORE AM I SENT</small><a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.</p>

<p>This then was the end of his ministry. He
was to preach the word; but was not obliged
to see that it took effect, or to wait the success
of it. How repugnant then had it been to this
end, to waste unnecessary time and power on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
unbelieving Nazareth, when so many other
cities, and those better disposed, claimed their
share of each!</p>

<p>But, further, the dispositions of these people
towards him were such, as seemed likely, not
only to retard and interrupt, but totally to
<i>prevent</i> the execution of his ministry. They
would either have found means, had he continued
longer with them, to deliver him into the
hands of the Jewish rulers, or by some act of
violence would have taken away his life. This
appears from the rage with which they drove
him out of their city, and from their purpose,
as St. Luke relates the story, to <i>cast him down
headlong from the brow of the hill, whereon
their city was built</i><a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. So that his attempt to
convert them by more miracles, might have
put an untimely end to his ministry, when it
was now but little more than begun. And,
though this event might at any time have been
prevented by an exertion of his miraculous
power, and without doubt would have been
prevented in that manner, had the conjuncture
made it necessary; yet this was no reason for
his exposing himself to that danger, since, as
we before observed, miracles are not to be
expected or employed, where the end in view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
may be accomplished by human means. Accordingly,
our Saviour consulted his own safety
on all occasions during the course of his ministry,
by every prudential method: And when
he afterwards armed his disciples with the
power of working miracles, he prescribed the
same conduct to them, and, when they found
themselves <i>persecuted in one city</i>, bade them
<i>flee to another</i><a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. It is generally thought, indeed,
that nothing but a miracle rescued him
out of the hands of the enraged people of Nazareth.
If so, his danger among them must
have been extreme, and shews the necessity of
his removing from them. However, if this last
miracle was wrought, it was one more added to
the number of those he had worked in that
city, and, like all the rest, was lost upon it.
On the whole, it appears certain then, that the
<i>unbelief</i> of these Nazarenes was a just reason
for Christ’s <i>not doing many miracles among
them</i>, since the opposite conduct would have
tended <i>to defeat the end and execution of his
general office</i>.</p>

<p>Still, the most direct and convincing answer
to the objection is behind: For,</p>

<p>IV. Lastly, I observe that Jesus <i>did not
many miracles</i> before the unbelieving men of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
Nazareth, <i>because</i> such a display of his power
would have <i>been contrary to a general rule of
conduct, which he prescribed to himself, and
that, on the highest reason</i>.</p>

<p>This rule was, <i>not to work a miracle upon
them, or for them, who were deficient in
faith</i>: By which term, <i>faith</i>, I do not mean
a grounded faith in him, as the Messiah, (for
that could only be produced originally by miracles)
but such an honesty and probity of
mind as might dispose them to believe on the
evidence of miracles. It was in this case, as in
that of <i>Parables, to him only who hath, more
was given</i>. And therefore the first question
be put to those, who repaired to him for a miraculous
relief of their necessities, was, <i>Do Ye
believe?</i> Are ye withheld by no fixed and
willful prejudices from supposing that one,
coming to you under the character of the Messiah,
is empowered to do this for you, or from
yielding to its evidence, when it is done? This
was so indispensable a rule with him, that
St. Mark, in relating this adventure at Nazareth,
goes so far as to say that he <small>COULD
NOT DO</small> many mighty works there because of
their unbelief<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>. The meaning of which is,
that there was, no <i>natural</i> indeed, but a <i>moral</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
impossibility of his working more miracles
there; that is, he <i>could not do it</i>, consistently
with the general principles, on which he
acted.</p>

<p>And that these principles were founded in
<i>the best reason</i>, no man can doubt who reflects,
that the highest possible favour, which
can be conferred on man, that is, a miracle
wrought for his salvation, reasonably supposes
some degree of desert, some prior dispositions
to profit by it; who reflects farther, that,
where such a preparation of mind is not,
the miracle is thrown away; nay, worse than
that, can only serve to the hurt and condemnation
of that person, on whom, or for whom it
is performed.</p>

<p>Men have a strange notion, that when God
intends to convince any one by the evidence of
miracles, he should repeat and enforce that
evidence, till it take effect, whether we will or
not; nay, that the most obstinate and determined
infidelity is only a stronger reason for
his contending with it. But this is a very presumptuous,
as well as injurious, conception of
the divine nature: It is presumptuous in the
highest degree, because it supposes that we
have a right to prescribe terms to infinite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
power and wisdom: It is greatly injurious to
the Supreme Being, because it supposes that
he has no regard to the moral worth of his
creatures, or even to any reasonable end, in
the wonders he does for them. The Scriptures
represent this matter in another light: they require
something, where much is given; they
expect from us to <i>have</i>, before we receive;
they suppose us in short to be moral agents,
and not machines. And our Lord himself,
speaking in the proverbial language of the
Jews, gives it as a special command to his
Disciples, <i>Not to cast that which is holy unto
dogs, not to cast their pearls before swine</i><a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>.
All this is agreeable to our best notions of the
divine wisdom and goodness, as well as to the
usual course of God’s providence; and therefore
on this footing only the conduct of Jesus
towards the unbelieving Jews of Nazareth is
abundantly justified.</p>

<p>To draw to a point, then, the substance of
what has been said. To the question, <i>why
Jesus did not more miracles, before the unbelieving?</i>
We reply, That such conduct was
not necessary to the end of miracles, which
was to afford a reasonable conviction—that it
was not likely to answer any good end, but, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
the contrary, would have been hurtful to such
unbelievers—that it tended to defeat the design
and success of Christ’s ministry, by narrowing
the sphere, of shortening the term of
it—that, lastly and chiefly, it was unreasonable
in itself, and contrary to the general
scheme and order of God’s moral government.</p>

<p>Let no man then abuse himself with foolish
imaginations, as if Christ was wanting in that
which became his office and mission; still
less, as if he acted from any caprice, or unconcern
for the souls of men, in not forcing
their belief; but least of all, as if his pretensions
had any thing to fear from the little faith
of those to whom he addressed himself, and
could only prevail with the weak and credulous,
with those who were unable or indisposed
to scrutinize his miracles. Even this last
insinuation has been made, not only without
grounds, but against the fullest evidence; the
miracles of Jesus having been numerous, public,
illustrious, and even acknowledged, at least
not convicted of imposture, by his bitterest
enemies, by those who were most active and
most able to examine into the truth and
reality of them.</p>

<p>With regard to the miracles in question, let
us be so ingenuous as to confess, that, if these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
were necessary to announce his office and character
to the men of Nazareth, more than
these were unnecessary, and that their unbelief
affords the best grounds to conclude, that they
were so. Consider too, that, if no reasons had
occurred to us for this conduct, it could not
certainly appear that it was unreasonable.
When we know, in fact, what the method of
God’s dealing with mankind has been, in any
instance, we may be able perhaps to discern
good reasons for it. But we can seldom affirm
with any shew of reason, from any preconceptions
or general speculations of our own, what
it should or must be. Here we are manifestly
out of our depth, and cannot stir a step without
the hazard of absurdity or impiety.</p>

<p>If we have reason to admit the divine authority
of our Religion, whatever conduct it
ascribes to Jesus, must be fit and right, however
impenetrable to us. If we admit it not,
our concern is to see that we have reason for
not admitting it. This matter is to be tried
by the evidence given of that authority only,
I mean by the external proofs, and historic
testimony, on which it rests. When this is
done, no slight cavils of reason, no fanciful
suspicions, no plausible objections, nor any
thing else but the most obvious contradiction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
in something it asserts to the clearest dictates
of the human understanding (which no man
has ever yet found) can possibly shake, or so
much as affect, that authority.</p>

<p>In the present case, we have seen how entirely
groundless the objection is to Christ’s
conduct at Nazareth. But if this objection
could not have been answered, nothing had
followed but a conviction of our ignorance.
It might still be true (as we now see it to be),
that Jesus acted agreeably to his divine character
<i>in not doing many miracles</i> before the
people of Nazareth, <i>because of their unbelief</i>.</p>

<h2 id="SERMON_XL">SERMON XL.<br />
<span class="medium">PREACHED MAY 23, 1773.</span></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">2 Cor.</span> iv. 5.</h3>

<p><i>We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the
Lord.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">We</span> may consider these words, either as an
<i>admonition</i> to the ministers of the Gospel, <i>To
preach not themselves, but Christ Jesus the
Lord</i>; or simply as a <i>fact</i>, which St. Paul
asserts of himself and the other Apostles, <i>That
they preached not themselves, but Christ Jesus
the Lord</i>.</p>

<p>In either sense, the words are instructive;
but I take them in the latter sense, only. I
would confirm and illustrate this assumed fact:
and then employ it as a medium to prove the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
divine authority of the sacred writings. If it
be true, <i>that the Apostles preached not themselves,
but Christ Jesus the Lord</i>, it will,
perhaps, be seen to follow, <i>That therefore
they preached not from their own private
suggestions, but by the direction of the spirit
of God</i>.</p>

<p>The assertion of the Text is, indeed, general,
and to this effect, “That a number of
persons, who were employed to convert the
world to the Religion of Jesus, did, in the
tenour of their lives and the course of their
ministry, pay no regard to their own interests
of any kind, and were only intent on the due
discharge of their commission.”</p>

<p>But the subject, in that extent, is too large
for a discourse of this nature. What I would
offer to your consideration, is <small>ONE SINGLE INSTANCE</small>
of that indifference which the Apostles
shewed to their own interests, I mean, <i>Their
total disregard of human applause in preaching
the Gospel</i>.</p>

<p>In this restrained sense of the words, men
may be said <i>to preach themselves</i>, in <small>TWO</small> respects:
When they shew a solicitude to set
themselves forth with advantage: 1. as to their
<small>MORAL</small> character. And 2. as to their <small>INTELLECTUAL</small>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<p>I. When men would give an advantageous
idea of their <i>moral character</i>, they usually express
this design, either, 1. <i>By representing
or insinuating their superior worth and virtue</i>:
Or, 2. <i>By suppressing or palliating what may
render it suspected</i>: Or, 3. lastly, <i>By dwelling
on such topics, and in such a manner, as may
give occasion to others to think well of their
moral qualities</i>.</p>

<p>Let us try the Apostolic writings by each of
these marks.</p>

<p>1. The first way that men take to illustrate
their <i>moral character</i>, is, <i>By representing,
or insinuating their worth and virtue, on
all occasions</i>.</p>

<p>Consider those apologists for themselves,
who have left us memoirs of their own lives.
You will find, in most of these, an ambitious
display of those moral virtues, by which they
desire to be distinguished. They lose no
opportunity of setting forth the purity of their
designs, and the integrity of their practice.
The rest, may do this with less pomp and affectation:
they may preserve a modesty in the
language, and a decent reserve in the air and
cast, of their narration. Still, the same purpose
is discoverable in all these writers, whether they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
openly proclaim, or nicely suggest and insinuate
their own importance. When men are actuated
with a strong desire of appearing in the
fairest light to others, it unavoidably breaks
out in some shape or other, and all the indirect
ways of address cannot conceal it from the intelligent
observer.</p>

<p>We have a great example in two, the most
extraordinary persons of the pagan world, I
mean, <small>XENOPHON</small>, and <small>JULIUS CÆSAR</small>. These
admired men thought fit to record their own
acts and atchievements; and have done it with
that air of neglect and unpretending simplicity,
which has been the wonder of mankind. Yet,
through all this apparent indifference, every
one sees the real drift of these elaborate volumes:
every one sees, that they are composed in such
a way as to excite the highest opinion, not of
their ability in the art of war only, but of the
justice, generosity, benevolence, in short, the
moral qualities of their respective authors. It
evidently appears that they designed to be their
own panegyrists; though none but such men
could have executed that design, in so inoffensive
and successful a manner.</p>

<p>But now, if we turn to the sacred writers, we
shall find no traces of their <i>preaching themselves</i>,
in this respect. These plain fishermen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
tell their story unambitiously, and without art;
or, if we call it art, it is such an one as Greece
and Rome had never been able to put in
practice. No exaggerations of what may be
thought praise-worthy in themselves: no oblique
encomiums on their own best qualities or actions:
no complacent airs in the recital of what may
reflect honour on their own characters: no
studied reserve and refinement in the turn and
language of their history.</p>

<p>If there be any virtue, which we may suppose
them more than commonly anxious to
arrogate to themselves, any moral quality, in
which they would shine out to the observation
of others, what more likely than an unshaken
fidelity to their Master? that Master, whom
they made it their glory, their sole glory, as the
Text speaks, <i>to preach</i>? Yet they are so far
from respecting their own credit in this particular,
that they relate their own infirmities and
miscarriages; they acknowledge how wavering
and precarious their <i>faith</i> was; nay, they tell
us that, in his last distresses, <i>they all forsook
him, and fled</i><a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.</p>

<p>2. This last circumstance reminds us of the
next artifice which men employ to set off their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
moral character, <i>that of suppressing or palliating
whatever may render it suspected</i>.</p>

<p>As accomplished persons, as the great men,
before mentioned, were, can we doubt that
many exceptionable steps were taken by them
in the affairs, they managed: that, on some
occasions, their prudence failed them, and their
virtue, on others; that their counsels and
measures were conducted, at times, with too
little honesty, or too much passion? Yet, you
will in vain look for any thing of this sort in
their large and particular histories. All is candid
and fair, judicious and well advised: every
thing speaks the virtuous man, and able commander.
The obnoxious passages are either
suppressed, or they are turned in such a way
as to do honour to their Relaters.</p>

<p>Or, take another instance. When Cicero
had offended against the capital law of his moral
code, that, which enjoined the love of his
country, first, by his backwardness to join the
camp of Pompey, and, afterwards, by his
prompt submission to the tyranny of Cæsar,
What is the conduct of the illustrious Roman
patriot, on this pressing occasion? Does he
frankly condemn these false steps, or does he
content himself with a simple relation of them?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
Neither of these things: He softens and disguises
the truth; he employs all his wit and
eloquence to palliate this inglorious desertion of
his principles, to himself and others.</p>

<p>I might add many other examples. But ye
see, in these, a striking contrast to the ingenuity
of the sacred writers. They study no
arts of evasion or concealment. They proclaim
their own faults, and even vices, to all the
world. One, acknowledges himself to have
been a furious bigot, a persecutor, and blasphemer<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>:
Another, relates his own cowardice,
ingratitude, and treachery<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. There is nothing
like a concert between them to cover each
other’s defects: They expose the vindictive zeal
of one<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>; the intolerant spirit of others<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>; the
selfish intrigues of all<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>. In a word, they give
up their moral character to the scorn and censure
of their readers, and appear solicitous for
nothing but the honour of their Master—<i>They
preach not themselves, but the Lord Jesus
Christ</i>.</p>

<p>But ye will say, this apparent candour was
the most consummate art; and that they confessed
some obnoxious passages in their lives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
to procure themselves credit in other instances.
This, no doubt, is sometimes the case
with artful writers and speakers: But then only,
when small defects and miscarriages are confessed;
or, when the facts are too notorious to
be dissembled; or, if perhaps they confess such
things of themselves, as are highly blameable,
and might otherwise have been concealed, they
do it to gain the praise of a more than ordinary
frankness and ingenuity, they apparently make
a matter of vanity, even of that confession<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>.
The case is much otherwise with the preachers
of Jesus. They scruple not to tax themselves
with the most odious vices; and these too,
many times of such a nature as shews, they
might well have been kept secret from all the
world; while yet the discovery is made in such
a way, that suspicion itself cannot charge them
with the design of drawing any credit to themselves
from it.</p>

<p>Hitherto, we have considered how many men may
contrive to celebrate or insinuate their own
virtues, to suppress or disguise their own
vices, in narratives or memorials of their lives;
and how free the Apostles are from the suspicion
of doing either. But the same design
may be prosecuted in writings of another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
sort: and we have writings of another sort
from the hands of the Apostles. I observe
then</p>

<p>3. That, when writers are studious of their
own fame, they find means, in any moral or
historic work, though themselves be not the
professed subject of it, to do honour to their
own character, <i>by dwelling on such topics, and
in such a manner, as may give occasion to
others to think well of their moral qualities</i>.</p>

<p>They declaim, perhaps, with much heat
against certain vices, or expatiate with much
complacency on certain virtues; or, they labour
some disgraceful portraits of bad men,
and draw their favoured characters with all the
heightenings of panegyrick: And who will
suppose, after this specimen of their zeal, that
they themselves are not adorned with those
good qualities, which they so studiously recommend,
or are not exempt from those bad
ones, which they so industriously expose? The
artifice is so common, that we have it played
upon us every day; and yet so imposing, that
it constantly succeeds with us. How many
popular characters does every one call to mind,
that have no foundation but in this favourable
prejudice! But let me carry your thoughts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
back to ancient times, and fix them on far
higher instances. Who that reads the moral
prefaces and digressions of the historian <small>SALLUST</small>,
but must imagine the author to have
been a model of ancient frugality and austere
manners? And who that looks into the philosopher
<small>SENECA</small>, and finds him all on fire in
celebrating some distinguished characters, and
exposing some detested ones, but will conclude
the writer to have been himself accomplished
in all virtue?</p>

<p>I make no enquiry, at present, into the real
characters of these illustrious persons: I pass
no judgment on the real merit of their books.
Their zeal might be an honest one; and the
form of their writings might be owing to that
zeal. But this, I observe, that the form itself
is well suited to the purpose of those who
would <i>preach themselves</i>; and that the sacred
writers have not thought fit to adopt this method.</p>

<p>Their books indeed are full of moral sentences
and moral precepts (for they are teachers of
morality by profession); but short, and simple;
and though earnestly enforced, not ostentatiously
displayed. The historic part of their
writings is wonderful for its calmness, I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
almost said, insensibility. No attempt to colour
their good or bad characters. Even the
transcendant virtues of their Master are left to
be collected rather from the simplest exposition
of what he said and did, than from any formal
representation of them: And, what is stranger
still, his betrayers and murderers are loaded
with no invective, nor set to scorn in any odious
lights<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>. These divine men are superior to the
prejudices even of virtue itself; and have so
little thought of deriving a vanity from their
own honest feelings, that we are almost left in
doubt, whether they were, indeed, actuated by
them.</p>

<p>II. Thus much for the indifference of the
sacred writers to their moral character: Let us
now see whether they are more concerned for
their <small>INTELLECTUAL</small>.</p>

<p>There are two ways which men take to display
their mental qualities: 1. <i>By labouring
to make appear an extraordinary acuteness of
understanding</i>: And 2. <i>By aiming at the
praise of extraordinary wit and eloquence</i>.</p>

<p>It is superfluous to observe to you how
these two characters predominate in all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
writings and speeches of uninspired men.
Consider, if there be one exception in all
those whom the world most approves and admires:
Consider, if there be not evident symptoms
of this vanity in every single writer or
speaker, that has undertaken to instruct or
reform mankind. I deny not, that many of
these have been persons of great modesty and
distinguished virtue: Yet they never lose sight
of their own mental accomplishments; they
never forget, under some shape or other, in
this respect, to <i>preach themselves</i>. Even He,
who now so freely censures this infirmity in
others, is, perhaps, at the instant, an example
of it, himself.</p>

<p>Let us see, then, if <i>the preachers of the
Gospel</i> have the singular prerogative to stand
clear of this general imputation.</p>

<p>1. They certainly lay no claim to any superior
quickness of understanding. On the
contrary, they relate many circumstances,
which clearly imply their own dulness and inapprehension.
They acquaint us with the gross
mistakes, they were apt to fall into, in their
conversations with their Master; they are at a
loss to comprehend his parables, nay to look
beyond the literal sense of the plainest figures;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
they even record the reproaches which Jesus
made to them on these occasions.</p>

<p>But this slowness of conception, it will be
said, was in their early unenlightened state,
and was, perhaps, affected by them to do honour
to their subsequent illuminations. Be it
so. But how do these illuminated men employ
the divine light, that was imparted to
them? In advancing curious theories in Morals,
or in framing subtle Metaphysical systems?
Do they affect a philosophic depth or accuracy
in their researches into human nature, or a
superior penetration in their reasonings about
spiritual things? Do they shine in paradoxes?
or strike with quaint aphorisms? Do they entertain
us with exquisite positions, or remote
conclusions? Nothing of all this. What they
teach of moral and divine things, is with the
air of men, not who make discoveries, but who
deliver known and familiar truths. They tell
us many things, which we knew not before:
But they tell them as matters of divine commission,
not of their own collection or investigation.
And, for the rest, they presume not
to speculate upon them, at all.</p>

<p>Indeed, the general subject of their discourses
was such, as gave no scope to the exercise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
and afforded no gratification to the pride, of
Reason. They publish to the world a matter
of fact, of which they were eye-witnesses;
they attest the death and resurrection of Jesus,
and preach remission of sins in his name.
These were the points <i>they witnessed both to
small and great; saying none other things
than those, which they had seen and heard,
and which the Prophets and Moses did say
come to pass</i><a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>. Is there any thing in
such a doctrine, as this, that looks like <i>preaching
themselves</i>? Can it be thought that such
teachers had an eye to the credit of their own
abilities, or that they meant to advance the reputation
of their own understandings above
that of other men?</p>

<p>2. Still less reason is there to charge this
ambition on their manner of preaching, or
to imagine that they sought the fame of ingenuity
from the terms in which they conveyed
their instructions to mankind. If the substance
of their doctrine was plain facts, their
language was that of plain men. They spake
not <i>with the enticing words of man’s wisdom</i>;
scarcely with the ordinary propriety, certainly,
not with what is called the purity and elegance,
of their tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>But the fact is not disputed, rather is objected
to them by such as question their inspiration
(with what reason, we shall presently
see); so that I may fairly conclude, that such
men could have no purpose to recommend themselves
by the arts of speaking, or, that, with
regard to the praise of wit and eloquence, they
could not possibly mean to <i>preach themselves</i>.</p>

<p>Not let it be said, that this unornamented
style of preaching was the effect of their ignorance,
and inability to reach the graces of a
juster manner. For, besides that it is no new
thing for men to affect what they have no
talents for, it is certain that <small>ONE</small> at least of the
Apostles, He, whose province it was to convert
the Gentile world, long since enamoured
of the study of eloquence, and who, of all the
Apostles, wrote most, it is certain, I say, that
this great man was not disqualified by a want
of parts or learning, from pretending to this
prize of eloquence, if his ambition had condescended
to it.</p>

<p>III. It appears then, with a reasonable degree
of evidence, that the writers of the New
Testament had no regard <i>to themselves</i>, that
is, to the reputation either of their Moral or
Intellectual virtues, in composing those books.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
The fact, as singular as it is, seems well established:
And I draw this interesting conclusion
from it, <i>That, therefore, they preached, not
from their own private suggestions, but by the
direction of the Holy Spirit</i>.</p>

<p>This conclusion follows undeniably from that
fact. For, if such a number of persons, of
different tempers, educations, and professions,
could be so disinterested as to overlook their
own credit in a point, which all other men
have so exceedingly at heart, and which no
other men, nay which no other single man has
ever been able to give up; and that too, when
they were teaching a divine religion, and might
therefore seem to have a decent pretence for
assuming all sorts of merit to themselves; if
this, I say, be a certain fact, what can we
conclude, but that the Spirit of God, to whose
enlightening influences they ascribed their
doctrine, over-ruled their natural self-love in
the manner of preaching it, and that <i>these
holy men spoke, as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost</i>?</p>

<p>To return then to the Text, and to conclude.
<i>We preach not ourselves</i>—said St. Paul, in his
own name and that of the other Apostles—<i>We
preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
the Lord</i>. The writings of these men are still
extant; and bear the fullest testimony to the
truth of what they assert. This, then, among
many others, is an intrinsic character, impressed
on those writings, of their divine original.
It may be regarded, as a standing
miracle, which, as oft as we revolve and consider
them, speaks aloud, as in a voice from
Heaven, that the Scriptures, they have left us,
are the <i>word and work of God</i>.</p>

<p>If their uninspired successors in the ministry
of the word be unable to copy so bright an
example of humility and self-denial, forgive
them this defect, or impute it, if you will, to
natural vanity and unsubdued self-love. But,
when ye chance to observe this infirmity in
others, forget not to say to yourselves, that
this high privilege of <i>preaching not themselves</i>
was reserved to the Evangelists and Apostles
only, to dignify their character; and to excite,
confirm, and support our faith; in a word, to
manifest to all the world, in the very frame and
texture of the sacred Oracles, that they were,
indeed, dictated by the Spirit of God.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Matth.</span> xi. 5.</h3>

<p><i>The Poor have the Gospel preached unto
them.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Many</span> circumstances, attending the Gospel
of Jesus, are such, as we should not previously
have expected: Yet, when duly considered,
they fully approve themselves to our best
reason.</p>

<p>We have a memorable instance, in the Text.
Among other marks, by which it pleased our
blessed Lord to authenticate his mission, one
was, <i>That the Poor had the Gospel preached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
unto them. Go</i>, (says he to the disciples of
John the Baptist, who had sent them to know
of Jesus, whether he were indeed the Messiah)
<i>Go, and shew John again those things which
ye do hear and see: The blind receive their
sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are
cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are
raised up, and</i> <small>THE POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL
PREACHED UNTO THEM</small>.</p>

<p>We are surprized, perhaps, on the first mention
of these words, to find this last circumstance
put upon a level with the rest, even with
that greatest of all miracles, <i>the raising of
the dead to life</i>. We may not immediately
apprehend, why the <i>Poor</i> should be thus considered
by the Saviour of the world; or how
the truth of his pretensions comes to be concerned
in this treatment of them. But, upon
inquiry, we shall find there were some important
reasons which determined our Lord to
this conduct, and which made that conduct, in
a peculiar manner, expressive of his person
and office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span>, This character was directly applied
to the Messiah, in the ancient prophecies. Our
Lord himself, in the text, quotes the very words
of Isaiah: So that, <i>in preaching the Gospel to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
the Poor</i>, he fulfilled that prediction, and so
far corresponded to the character, which the
word of prophecy had given of the Messiah.</p>

<p>But this circumstance, we may suppose,
would have been no part of the Messiah’s
character, but for reasons which made it fit and
right, that He should be thus distinguished.
Let us, further, inquire, then,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Secondly</span>, what those reasons, probably
were; only premising one word, to ascertain
the objects, both of the prophecy, and of our
Lord’s charitable attention.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but the word, <i>poor</i>, in the
prophecies alledged, and in Christ’s application
of them, is very capable of being understood in
a metaphorical or spiritual sense, and was even
intended to be so understood; I mean, in that
sense, which our Lord gives to the word, <i>Poor</i>,
when he says—<i>Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven</i><a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. But
this metaphorical sense does not exclude, it
rather supposes, the literal. For, who are <i>the
poor in spirit</i>, for the most part, but <i>the poor
in fortune</i>? they, whom neither the pride of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
knowledge and education, nor the pride of
wealth and place, has corrupted with vain ideas
of their own sufficiency? But, there is a peculiar
reason for the literal interpretation of the
Text. For the words, <i>blind</i>, <i>lame</i>, and <i>deaf</i>,
have, likewise, their metaphorical sense in the
prophet, as well as the word, <i>poor</i>. Yet our
Lord alledges the completion of the prophecy,
in the literal meaning of those words; for he
refers the messengers of John to what <i>they saw
and heared</i>; to the miracles, he was then working,
or had worked, on <i>the blind, lame, and
deaf</i>, that is, in restoring their bodily senses
and members<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. So that, when the poor are
spoken of by Jesus, at the same time, we must
needs understand him as speaking of the <i>poor</i>,
properly so called, that is, of the lower ranks
of people, whom he was even then instructing,
as well as healing.</p>

<p>We see, then, That Christ <i>preached the
Gospel to the poor</i>, in the literal, as well as
spiritual sense of that word: And, in so doing,
he both fulfilled the whole extent of the prophecy;
and, as we shall now find, gave an
eminent proof of the <small>GOODNESS</small> and <small>WISDOM</small> of
his own character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>For, consider the state of the <i>poor</i>, how
much they wanted, and how much better, than
the rich, they deserved, instruction, when our
Lord, in mercy, came <i>to preach the Gospel to
them</i>.</p>

<p>I. The condition of the <i>poor</i>, that is, of the
people at large, was truly deplorable, at that
time. They were every where treated by their
superiors with the utmost contempt, and left
to struggle with an almost invincible ignorance
and corruption.</p>

<p>The Jews, indeed, had the benefit of a divine
law: but their Scribes and Doctors <i>had made
it of none effect, by their traditions</i><a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>. They
had corrupted the word of God, by their fanciful
cabbalistical glosses; and had debased their
holy ritual, into a frivolous and sordid superstition.
They had <i>the key of knowledge</i> in
their hands; but they neither employed it to
the purpose of opening the true meaning of the
Scriptures, themselves, nor would suffer the
people to make this use of it. In the mean
time, their pride increased with their other
vices: they thought themselves <i>wise and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
prudent<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, and righteous</i><a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>; and, in sovereign admiration
of their own worth and knowledge,
<i>they despised others</i>. Their insolence to the
<i>poor</i> was so transcendant, that they reproached
them for that ignorance, which themselves had
occasioned; and even checked their endeavours
to understand the true meaning of their law, in
terms of the bitterest scorn and execration.
<i>Have any of the Rulers or Pharisees</i>, said
they, <i>believed in Jesus? But this people<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>,
that knoweth not the law, are accursed.</i></p>

<p>Such was the state of the <i>poor</i>, among the
Jews: and that of the Gentile poor was no
better. As the former were only insulted, and
not instructed, by their <small>RABBIS</small>; So the <i>latter</i>
were just as ill treated by their <small>PHILOSOPHERS</small>.</p>

<p>These men, indeed, <i>professed themselves
wise</i>; and had, in some respects, a juster claim,
than the Jewish doctors, to that proud, distinctive
appellation. Though their reasoning,
on many subjects (on which, however, they
valued themselves most) was little better than
that of the Cabbalists; yet, in moral matters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
which are of the highest concern to mankind,
they had been able to trace out some plausible
and ingenious theories, and had even penetrated
so far as to apprehend some general and
fundamental principles of natural religion. Yet
all this was matter of vanity among them, rather
than of public use. Their most interesting
speculations were either confined to their
schools, or secreted from the common eye, in
their mysteries. Their moral systems were
calculated to amuse, to polish, and, we will
say, to instruct the higher ranks of men; but
they were composed in such a way, and proceeded
on such principles, that the vulgar could
be little benefited by them. And, for what
they knew of religious truth, they studiously
kept it from the <i>poor</i>, and left them to the
tyranny of their senseless, their impure, their
abominable superstitions. Even Socrates himself,
though he laboured very commendably to
reform the lives of his fellow-citizens, yet laboured
to little effect, as he would not, or
durst not, disgrace their idolatries, the source
of all their corruption and misery. The rest
of these wise men were well contented, at most,
with being <i>wise to themselves</i>; they stood aloof
from the prophane vulgar; and contemplated,
with much complacency, or with much disdain,
the popular errors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>Such, and so wretched were the <i>poor</i>, when
our blessed Lord came to announce the good
tidings of salvation to them! Incapable of
themselves to find out or to understand their
duty, and misled, neglected, or contemned by
those who should have been their instructors;
lost in error and in vice, with no prospect of
recovering themselves out of either; without
guides, and without friends; in a word, <i>without
hope, and without God in the world</i><a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>;
What could equal their wants and their distresses?
And how loudly did they cry to
Heaven for some friendly hand to be stretched
out, some celestial light to be dispensed, to
them?</p>

<p>But, perhaps, these unhappy men deserved
not the care of Heaven. And, without doubt,
if we put their claim on that footing, it will be
difficult to make out their title to such distinction.
Yet they had something, too, to plead
for themselves, something to engage the regards
of their merciful Creator, if it be true, as I
observed,</p>

<p>II. In the next place, that their hearts, depraved
as they were, were yet not so utterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
perverse, as those of the <i>rich and great and
wise</i>, who poured such contempt upon them.</p>

<p>And, for our satisfaction in this point, we
need but look into the Gospel-history; where
we find, from many facts and testimonies, that
the poorer sort among the Jews were they who
gave the best proofs of their disposition to embrace
the doctrine, and acknowledge the pretensions,
of Jesus.</p>

<p>When he <i>preached</i> to the Jews, the Scribes
and Pharisees, that is, the <i>rich and wise</i>, almost
universally and without exception, cavilled at
his doctrine, perverted his words, and sought
occasion only <i>how they might entangle him in
his talk</i><a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>. But the people, giving way to the
ingenuous sense of their own minds, <i>heared
him gladly</i><a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>: They were even <i>very attentive
to hear him</i><a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. Nor let it be thought, that the
love of novelty, or some worse motive, which
oft seduces the populace in such cases, was the
cause of this attention. They give another, and
better reason of it—<i>Never man</i>, say they,
<i>spake like this man</i><a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>: Again, <i>they were
astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
as one having authority, and not as the
Scribes</i><a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>; That is, they had the sense to perceive
there was a weight and force and importance
in his doctrines, which they had never
found in any other, and, least of all, in the
light, frothy, and frivolous doctrines of their
Scribes; and they had the honesty to acknowledge
and proclaim their own feelings.</p>

<p>Again; When Jesus wrought his miracles
before the Jews, while their superiors were unconvinced,
or blasphemed against conviction,
the multitudes cried out in admiration, <i>Is not
this the Son of David<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>?</i>—<i>It was never</i>, they
say, <i>so seen in Israel</i><a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>—With a becoming
candour and piety, <i>they marvelled, and glorified
God, who had given such power unto
men</i><a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus much for the Jews. And the same
difference, between the <i>rich and poor</i>, afterwards
appeared, when the Apostles turned
themselves to the Gentiles. So that St. James
reasons upon it, as a certain fact. <i>Do not rich
men oppress you, and draw you before the
Judgment seats? Do they not blaspheme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
that worthy name by which ye are called<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>?</i>
And St. Paul to the same purpose, when
appeals to the Gentile Christians themselves—<i>Ye
see your calling, my brethren, how that
not many wise men after the flesh, not many
mighty, not many noble, are called</i><a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>.</p>

<p>And, if we extend our inquiries beyond the
Apostolic age, we still find, that, while councils
and synagogues, priests and philosophers, governors
and kings, were confederated against
the rising church, the <i>poor</i>, the <i>weak</i>, the <i>ignorant</i>,
the <i>ignoble</i>, very readily, and in great
numbers, pressed into it.</p>

<p>Considering then this fairness of mind, which
distinguished the <i>poor</i>, together with their
multiplied necessities, we shall cease to think
it strange that our blessed Lord should first and
principally <i>preach the Gospel to them</i>; and
that this circumstance should be predicted of
him, and urged by himself, as characteristic of
his person and office. For what could distinguish
the divine Messiah more, than this
condescension to those who most needed, and
best deserved, his instruction? Who can wonder
that, <i>when he saw the multitudes</i>, thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
circumstanced, <i>he was moved with compassion
on them, because they fainted</i><a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>, under the
merciless vexations of their superiors, <i>and were
scattered abroad</i><a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>, and left exposed to every
injury, <i>as sheep having no shepherd</i><a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>? Could
any splendor of miracles more illustrate his
character, than that affectionate address to the
poor people, groaning under all their burthens,
of which the pride of wealth and wisdom was
not the least, <i>Come unto me, ye that labour
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me,
for I am meek and lonely in heart, and ye shall
find rest to your souls</i><a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>?</p>

<p>Our Lord’s whole ministry seems uniformly
directed to this end of beating down the insolence
of all worldly distinctions, which had too
much vilified and degraded human nature.
For this purpose, he condescended, himself,
to be born in the lowest rank of life, to be
brought up in what the world calls a mean and
mechanic profession, to converse chiefly with
the poor and indigent, to take for his companions
and disciples the most sordid of the
people, and to propagate his religion by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
weakest and most unpromising instruments:
<i>Chusing</i>, as St. Paul divinely expresses it, <i>the
foolish things of the world, to confound the
wise; the weak things of the world, to confound
the things that are mighty; And the
base things of the world, and things which
are despised, yea, and things which are not,
to bring to nought things that are: That no
flesh should glory in his presence</i><a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>.</p>

<p>In a word, he seems studiously to have bent
his whole endeavours, to vindicate the honour
of depressed humanity; to support its weakness,
to countenance its wants, to ennoble its misery,
and to dignify its disgrace.</p>

<p>Nor let any one presume to insinuate, that
this conduct of our blessed Saviour was directed
to other ends; As if he sought, by this application
to the people, to engage <i>them</i> in the
support of his new kingdom, and then, by
their noise and numbers, to force the rest into
it. The suspicion is utterly without grounds.
Jesus made no factious use of the popularity
he acquired by his condescension; he discountenanced
and repressed every effort of that
nature; and, though his care was chiefly employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
about the <i>poor</i>, it was not confined to
them: He <i>preached</i> indiscriminately to all,
he did his miracles before all, in public, in
open day-light, in the presence of the greatest
persons, and in places of the greatest resort;
in short, his doctrines and his credentials were
equally offered to the examination of men of
all ranks and all denominations, of the doctors
and rulers of the Jewish people, as well as of
the people themselves. This, an impostor
most assuredly would not have done.</p>

<p>We have now, then, a reasonable account
given us, why it pleased God that the Saviour
of the world should be known by this mark,
among others, of <i>his preaching the Gospel to
the poor</i>. The <small>GOODNESS</small> of his character was
signally illustrated, by this gracious conduct.
I have only to observe, further, that his <small>WISDOM</small>
was equally displayed by it: And both
together must needs furnish a presumptive argument
of his divine mission.</p>

<p>Had the ablest speculative philosopher been
consulted about the proper method of reforming
the world, though with the attending evidence
and authority of miracles, I suppose his plan
for effecting this design would have been wholly
different from that, which was taken. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
would have counselled an application, not to the
<i>poor</i> chiefly, if to them at all, but to the <i>rich</i>,
the <i>great</i>, and the <i>wise</i>. The minister of this
important charge would have been directed to
shew himself in the most conspicuous scene,
to make the capital of the world, imperial
Rome, the head-quarters of his mission, to
perform his miracles before the Roman senate,
and to proselyte, first of all, the wise and
learned of that empire; As conceiving this to
be the readiest way to the establishment of his
new Religion, and trusting to the power of
these great instruments, as to some irresistible
vortex, to draw the people with them, into
the general profession of it.</p>

<p>This, or something like this, we may imagine,
would have been the language of human
wisdom. But what would have been the event
of these profound and politic counsels? Most
probably, the design would not have taken
effect. The interests, the prejudices, the pride,
and the very philosophy of the world would
have revolted against it. The plainest miracles
would have been shuffled over, as the sleights
of magick: and the divinest truths, been derided
as unlearned and ignorant conceits.</p>

<p>But what if the event had been otherwise?
What, if the new religion had prospered and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
acquired an establishment by these mighty
means? Posterity would then have turned the
argument in another manner. They would
have accounted, and with some reason, for
this revolution in the sentiments of mankind,
not from the will of Heaven, but the power
and policy of men. They would have sought
the origin of this triumphant religion in the
operation of human causes, and not in the
controlling influence of divine. The new system
might be preferred to many others that
have prevailed in the world, but would be
thought to have made its way by the same
means. It would still be considered, as a mere
human engine, calculated to serve the ends of
society, and not to interest the conscience, as
proceeding from the sole authority of God.
And what could have been opposed to these
suggestions? The cause is plainly adequate to
the effect: And, thus, the glory of God would
have been obscured; and the dispensation itself,
exposed to contempt.</p>

<p>See then <i>the riches both of the goodness and
wisdom of God</i>: Of his <small>GOODNESS</small>, in caring
for the poor; and of his <small>WISDOM</small>, in providing by
his use of so unlikely means, <i>that our faith
should not stand in the wisdom of man, but in
the power of God</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>To conclude; <i>the ways of God are</i>, very
frequently, <i>not our ways</i><a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>; Yet, when the
difference is most striking, a diligent inquiry
will sometimes convince us (as in the case before
us) that they may be justified even to our
apprehensions: The use of which conviction
should be, to satisfy us, in other cases, that
his ways are always adorable, even when to US,
in this state of weakness and blindness, they
are <i>past finding out</i>.</p>

<span class="medium">PREACHED JANUARY 24, 1773.</span></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">John</span> xiv. 2.</h3>

<p><i>In my Father’s house are many mansions</i>: <small>IF
IT WERE NOT SO, I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU</small>.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">These</span> words are not a little remarkable;
and, if carefully considered, will be found to
make very much for the honour of the Christian
religion, and its divine author.</p>

<p>Our blessed Lord was now upon the point of
leaving the world. He foresaw, distinctly, his
own approaching death, and the discouragements
of all sorts, which, of course, would
oppress his disciples, when he should be taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
from them. He therefore applies himself, in
this farewell address, to animate their courage
by the assurance of future glory. “<i>Let not your
heart be troubled</i>, says he, at the worst that
may befall you: <i>Ye believe in</i> the general providence
of <i>God</i>: <i>believe also in me</i>, in the
care which I shall especially take to see an
ample recompence made you for all your sufferings
on my account. <i>For in my Father’s
house are many mansions</i>; wherein each of you,
according to his deserts, shall for ever enjoy
an inviolable repose and felicity. And on this
promise ye may rely with the most entire confidence:
for know this, That, <i>if it were not
so</i>, no consideration should have induced me
to fill your minds with vain hopes; on the
other hand, <i>I would have told you</i> the plain
truth, how unwelcome soever it might be to
you.”</p>

<p>We have here, then, from the mouth of
Christ himself, an express disavowal of <small>RELIGIOUS
FRAUD OR IMPOSTURE</small>; and that, in a
point where wise men have sometimes thought
themselves at liberty, nay under an obligation,
to <i>lye</i> for the public service, and in a conjuncture,
too, when, if ever, it might seem allowable
for a good man to deceive his friends on a
mere principle of compassion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

<p>For what so beneficial, it may be said, to
mankind, at large, as the persuasion of a future
state, in which their happiness shall be proportioned
to their virtue? And who, that has
any bowels, would carry his attachment to
strict truth so far, as not to suffer an unhappy
friend to <i>die</i>, at least, in this persuasion, when
the hopes of life, or the comforts of it, had
entirely forsaken him?</p>

<p>These questions are plausible: but our Lord,
who was <i>the Truth</i>, as well as <i>the Life</i>, governed
himself by other maxims. He knew
that the real interests of mankind are only, or
are best promoted by veracity; that every degree
of fraud, though it may have some immediate,
or temporary good effects, is, in the
order of things, productive of much mischief;
is injurious to our moral and reasonable nature,
which was made for truth, and finds its proper
satisfaction in it; is liable to detection, to suspicion,
at least; and if it be but the latter
(entertained on probable grounds, and become,
as it soon will be, universal), not only the
chief benefits of the imposture are, thenceforth,
lost, but truth itself, in other cases, is taken
for imposture: of which there is not a more
deplorable instance, than in the subject we are
now considering: for, it being well known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
that men have been forward to deceive each
other in matters of religion, and particularly
in what concerns the hope or fear of a future
state, hence, an incurable suspicion has sunk
deep into the minds of too many, concerning
Christianity itself; as if, in this momentous
doctrine of life and immortality, it amused us
only, as many other schemes of religion have
done, with a plausible and politic fiction.</p>

<p>But our blessed Lord, as I said, had other
views of this matter, and governed himself by
other principles. He knew, who it was that
had been <i>a liar</i>, and therefore <i>a man-slayer
from the beginning</i><a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>; and left it to him, the
adversary of God and man, to signalize himself
by <i>murderous</i> deceit and imposture. For
himself, he tells his disciples, whom of all
men, it concerned him most to possess with
this salutary belief of a future state; He tells
them, I say, that, instead of deluding them
with a groundless hope, he would certainly,
and even at this season, which made that hope
so infinitely precious, declare to them the
simple truth, and on no account permit them
to continue under a false (if it had been false),
though flattering persuasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>Shall we believe this great teacher, on his
own word? Or, will you suspect, that even
this uncommon declaration, uncommon in the
founder of a new religion, was only a refinement
of art and policy; and that Jesus hoped,
by this shew of frankness, to propagate his
favourite imposture the more successfully in
the world?</p>

<p>I know, and have just now observed, to what
lengths our ingenious suspicions on this subject
are apt to run. But consider the circumstances;
and then judge for yourselves, whether
the suspicion, in this case, be well founded.</p>

<p><i>In my Father’s house</i>, says he, <i>are many
mansions: if it were not so, I would have told
you</i>. And can we doubt his sincerity in this
declaration, when he was now to make an
experiment of its truth; and the deception, if
it were one, was first to operate on himself,
before it affected others? A speculative reasoner,
or a politic legislator, when planning his system
at his ease, and in no danger of being called
upon to make trial of his own principles, might
discourse with much complacency, though with
little inward belief, of a happy futurity. But
for one, who was just stepping into that world,
of which he announced such wonders, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
going, by one confident venture, to put his
doctrine to the proof, and to expire in torments
from a view to his own promises; for one, I
say, thus circumstanced, knowingly to delude
himself and others, is not in human nature,
unless perverted by such a degree of weakness
or vanity, as no man will think chargeable on
the character of Jesus. Socrates, the ablest and
the honestest of the ancient sages, had, on
moral principles, reasoned himself into a
favourable opinion of the soul’s immortality.
He had often expressed this opinion to his
friends, in terms of some force; and there were
times in which he seemed very little, if at all, to
question the truth of it. Yet, when he came
to die, and had taken the fatal cup into his
hand, his resolution gives way, he hesitates,
and leaves his followers, after first of all confessing
himself to be left, in the utmost uncertainty
on this momentous topic: a conduct
surely very natural, and becoming a wise man,
who had not, and who knew he had not, the
most convincing evidence of its reality!</p>

<p>But there are further reasons to think that
Jesus was sincere in making this declaration to
his disciples, suggested to us by <i>the terms of
his religion</i>, and by <i>his own personal character</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>Those <i>terms</i> were, that whoever believed in
the name of Christ, that is, became a convert
to his religion, was thenceforth to encounter all
sorts of difficulties, and dangers, and distresses,
nay, death itself, and that, in every dreadful
shape, which the malice of the world could
invent, rather than to retract or forego his open
profession of it. This, the disciples had been
often told by their Master: who, whether as a
prophet, or a wise man (it matters not which,
to our present purpose) had distinctly foreseen,
and had set before them in all its force, what
they were to expect and to suffer for his sake,
and the sake of the Gospel. Other teachers of
religion and philosophy required no such terms
of their followers, or had reason to apprehend
no such consequences from the propagation of
their opinions. They might therefore keep
their doubts to themselves, if they had any,
of a future state: In Jesus, such reserve, or
dissimulation, would have been the most unfeeling
cruelty.</p>

<p>And against whom is this suspicion indulged?
Why against <small>HIM</small> (and that was the other consideration
I mentioned) whose personal character
was that of goodness and philanthropy itself.
This character shines out in every page of the
Gospel. We see it in all he said and did to his
disciples, whom he calls his <i>friends</i>, and treats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
as such on all occasions: witness his condescension
to their infirmities, his concern for their
safety (while it might consist with their duty),
his compassion for their sufferings, his friendliness
of temper, we may even say, his affection
for their persons and virtues. In short, the
sympathetic tenderness of his nature was
evidenced in all ways, in which it could possibly
shew itself, even by that of tears.</p>

<p>Now, put these two things together, his <i>deep
concern for the interests of his disciples</i>, on the
one hand, and <i>the severe injunctions he gave
them</i>, on the other, and see if there be any
possibility of mistrusting our Lord’s good faith
in that memorable declaration—<i>In my Father’s
house there are many mansions</i>: <small>IF IT WERE
NOT SO, I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU</small>.</p>

<p>His language on the subject, so interesting
to them, had, indeed, been always the same.
<i>Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you,
and persecute you, and shall say all manner of
evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoyce,
and be exceeding glad: for great is your
reward in heaven<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>.</i> This he said in the beginning
of his ministry: This he now repeats in
the close of it; but with that remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
assurance (now for the first time given, and,
from the <i>time</i> of giving it, not more important,
than it is credible) <i>if it were not so</i>, if your
<i>reward in heaven</i> were not such, and so great,
as I have ever affirmed it to be, in recompence
of all your sufferings, past and to come, for my
sake, I would not have left you under an error
in what so infinitely concerns You—<i>I would</i>
expressly <i>have told you of it</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The use</span> we have to make of these reflections
is, to see what our <i>Lord’s character</i> truly was;
and what our reasonable <i>hopes and expectations</i>
from him are.</p>

<p>I. But for this declaration, it might be
thought, that Jesus, pushed on by an eager ambition
of being the founder of a sect, had, for
his <i>own</i> ends, preached up this alluring doctrine
of a future state; or, that, heated by a moral
enthusiasm, he had overlooked the mischiefs
of his scheme, in contemplation of the <i>public</i>
ends, it might serve, as applied to the important
interests of virtue and religion. Surmises of
this sort might have sprung up in the minds of
men, not prejudiced against the author of our
faith; and would certainly have been cherished
and malignantly insisted upon by his enemies.
But it now appears, that he disclaimed all such
views and purposes: that he was cool enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
to see the iniquity of all religious deception;
and just enough to acknowledge the cruelty of
it, in the present instance. If he had not
certainly known the truth of his doctrine, he
would have recalled and disowned it. He felt,
in his own case, what it was to encounter death
for conscience-sake: and he knew what deaths
others were to encounter on the like grounds of
persuasion. But <i>for the joy that was set before
him</i>, how could the shame and agony of that
cross be endured? And, if there be no recompence
of reward, should he expose to such, or
to equal sufferings, his honest, unsuspecting,
affectionate followers? The instant moment<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>,
the imposed duty<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>, the foreseen event<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>, the
upright mind<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>, the feeling heart<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>, all conspire
to satisfy us, that Jesus was not, could not,
be the fraudulent, that is, the insensible, the
unrelenting, the merciless inventor or publisher
of a politic fable, but a teacher of truth
and righteousness sent from God.</p>

<p>Thus much for our Lord’s <i>general character</i>;
which we shall do well to keep in mind,
when we meditate on any part of his instructions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
to us; but more especially, when, for
our singular comfort, we attend to his great
doctrine of a <small>BLESSED IMMORTALITY</small>. Our
divine Master has in the clearest and fullest
terms, announced this doctrine to us; and,
what is more, he has anxiously removed the
only possible doubt, which we could have of
its truth, by disclaiming the politic use, which
too many others had presumed to make of it.</p>

<p>II. It follows, that we may rely, with confidence,
on this invaluable promise of a future
life; the only source of peace and comfort to
the mind, without which the disordered scene
of this life is inexplicable to the wisest men,
and scarce supportable by the happiest; we
may, I say, rely with safety on this <i>glorious
hope</i><a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> of immortality, unless we will suppose
that Jesus meant to deceive us even then, when
he most deliberately and solemnly pledged
himself to us for his veracity: a supposition,
which is, in truth, as foolish as it is indecent.</p>

<p>Assured therefore, as we are, that our Saviour
both taught this doctrine, and taught it
without the least mixture of guile or dissimulation,
let us hold fast our expectation of it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
the end; and in all the troubles of this life,
whether endured for conscience-sake or not,
provided only they be such as consist <i>with</i> a
good conscience, let us reckon with certainty
on our title to one of those eternal <i>mansions</i>,
of which there are so <i>many in the house of our
heavenly Father</i>; and that, for the sake and
through the merits of our <small>LORD JESUS CHRIST</small>;
the author of our salvation, as well as the proclaimer
of it: our merciful Redeemer, at once,
and infallible Instructor; to whom be all honour,
praise, and thanksgiving, now and for ever. Amen.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">John</span> xvi. 12, 13.</h3>

<p><i>I have yet many things to say unto you, but
ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when
he, the Spirit of truth, shall come, he will
guide you into</i> <small>ALL TRUTH</small>: <i>for he shall not
speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall
hear, that shall he speak: and</i> <small>HE WILL
SHEW YOU THINGS TO COME</small>.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> is scarce a page in the Gospels,
which to an attentive reader may not afford a
striking proof of their divine original.</p>

<p>We have an instance in the words before
us: in which, Jesus, now about to leave the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
world, tells the disciples, that he had <i>many
things to say unto them</i>, which were not proper
for their ear at this time, but that these,
and all other necessary truths should hereafter
be imparted to them by a <i>divine spirit</i>, to be
sent from heaven to be their guide and instructor:
that, from <i>him</i>, they should learn
what, for the present, he forbore to communicate
to them, of his views and purposes in the
religion, they were to teach mankind; nay,
and that this divine <i>Spirit of truth would
shew them things to come</i>.</p>

<p>Now Jesus, I suppose, whatever else may
be thought of him, will be readily acknowledged
to have been, at least, a discreet and
wise man: for without a very high degree of
discretion and wisdom, it was plainly impossible
for him to do the great things, he did; I
mean, to be so successful, as he was, in imposing
a new faith and religion on mankind.
They, who take Christianity for an imposture,
must confess, at least, that it was an imposture,
artfully contrived, and ably conducted:
otherwise, the effects of it could never have
been, what we see they are.</p>

<p>But would any man, acting on the principles
of human wisdom, only, have given an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
assurance of this kind (an assurance, too, that
seemed not <i>necessary</i>) to those whom he
thought fit to entrust with the care of his imposture,
when yet he must certainly know that
he could not make good to them what he had
promised; and when they, to whom such assurance
was given, might easily, and, as he
must foresee from his knowledge of human
nature, would certainly abuse it, to selfish
ends of their own, not consistent with his,
and to the hurt of that very cause, which he
wanted to promote?</p>

<p>Say, that he had, only, told them—<i>this divine
spirit shall instruct you in many things
concerning my religion, which I have not,
myself, thought fit to reveal to you</i>—would
not this general promise have opened a door
to all sorts of fraud, or extravagance? And
could he reasonably expect that any well-concerted
scheme of religion, such as was likely
to make its fortune in the world, would be
delivered and established by men, who were
commissioned to enlarge his system, at pleasure,
and as their various passions, or fancies,
might suggest? And all this, on the same
authority with that which he had claimed to
himself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<p>Suppose, they were <i>honest</i>, or, <i>faithful to
him</i>, that is, disposed to teach nothing but
what should agree to their Master’s doctrine,
yet who could answer for their skill or judgment?
And, if they were <i>dishonest</i>, or <i>unfaithful</i>,
what ruin must not this license of
building on his doctrine, have brought on the
structure, he had already raised?</p>

<p>When Mark Antony was allowed to <i>forge</i> a
will for Cæsar, we know the use he made of
that liberty. But had he been a better man,
than he was, and inclined to give out that only
for Cæsar’s will, which might probably seem
to be so, yet his capacity to make a will for
Cæsar, in all respects uniform, and consistent
with that great man’s known views and character,
might well be called in question, notwithstanding
the whole contrivance depended
on himself; much more, if the arduous task
had been entrusted to <i>eleven</i> persons, besides,
of different abilities and dispositions.</p>

<p>Still, the case is more desperate, than we
have hitherto supposed. Besides a liberty of
adding what new consistent doctrines, they
pleased, to the doctrine of Jesus, the disciples
have a greater and more dangerous power
committed to them, a power of <i>prophesying</i>,
or foretelling <i>things to come</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

<p>To see how the case stands on this last supposition,
consider, 1. <i>What is implied in this</i>
<small>PROPHETIC</small> <i>power</i>. 2. <i>What abuses are likely
to be made of such an assumed power by</i> <small>ANY</small>
<i>men whatsoever</i>. And, 3. <i>What peculiar
abuses of it were to be expected from</i> <small>SUCH</small>
<i>men, as the disciples</i>. Consider, I say, these
three particulars, and then, upon the whole,
determine for yourselves, whether any man of
ordinary prudence would have commissioned
his followers to exercise such a power; or, if
he had done so, and had been an impostor,
whether the event could possibly have been
what it clearly was.</p>

<p>1. The <i>prophetic power</i>, implies an ability
of looking into the future history of mankind;
of foreseeing what revolutions shall happen in
states and kingdoms; what shall be the issue
of depending wars, or counsels: what the prosperous,
or adverse fortune shall be of public,
or private persons; of those, who have any
authority over us, or connexion with us; of
individuals, or collective bodies of men; of
friends, or enemies. Whoever has this extraordinary
power committed to him, or who
thinks he has, has the characters of all men
at his mercy; can blast the reputation of, the
wisest and best men, by a charge of follies and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
crimes, <i>not yet committed</i>; or can raise the
credit of the worst and weakest, by covering
their <i>future</i> life with wisdom and honour.
He can intimidate the greatest men by announcing
their disgrace and ruin; or exalt
the meanest by bringing out to view their
successes and triumphs. In a word, he can
speak peace or war, fame or infamy, life or
death, to any state or person, against whom
he thinks fit to level this powerful engine of
inspiration.</p>

<p>And as all men, so all <i>times</i>, are equally
within his reach. He can pursue the objects
of his love or hate through ages to come; and
can excite hopes and fears in the breasts of
those, who are not to appear on the stage of
the world, till many centuries after he has left
it, and when himself has nothing to apprehend,
let his predictions take what turn they will,
from the shame of detection.</p>

<p>Such then being the nature of this mighty
privilege to foretell <i>things to come</i>, you cannot
but see</p>

<p>2. In the next place, <i>how liable this power
is to be abused by</i> <small>ANY</small> <i>men whatsoever, who
have a pretence to assume it</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>Make, if you will, the most favourable supposition,
that these pretended prophets are
<i>able and learned</i>: But then, what endless
schemes of fraud, of policy, of imposture, may
ye not expect from the dextrous management
of this faculty! Revolve with yourselves the
history of ancient divination, or modern prophecy,
when lodged in the hands of artful and
designing men; and see, what portentous
abuses must needs arise from this commission,
and yet what certain disgrace and confusion to
the memory of those, to whom it is given.</p>

<p>What blessings will not men, entrusted with
this convenient foresight of futurity, lavish on
their own friends, or party! And what curses,
what terrors, equally belied in the event, will
they not scatter over the persons or affairs of
rivals and enemies, for the gratification of a
present passion or interest!</p>

<p>Suppose them cool enough to distrust the
reality of their inspiration, yet the temptation,
to make the pretence of it subservient to their
own views, would be almost irresistible: Or
suppose them, on the other hand, to prophesy
with good faith, this genuine enthusiasm might
enable them to act their part more naturally
indeed, but, in the end, not more successfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>Had then the Apostles been, each of them,
as provident and wise, as their Master himself,
and as much persuaded of their own inspiration,
as he could desire them to be, they would
not, we may be sure, have been encouraged by
him, if an impostor only, to think themselves
possessed of a prophetic power, when it must
have turned to the ruin of his cause, on every
supposition; I mean, equally on the supposition
of its being regarded as a real or pretended,
power; that is, whether the Apostles
were guided by the views of a dishonest policy
themselves, or were the honest dupes of their
Master’s policy. But there is</p>

<p>3. Still more to be said on the improbability
of a wise man’s giving such an assurance to
men <i>qualified and circumstanced</i>, as the Apostles
were, in other words, <i>to men of their</i>
<small>PECULIAR</small> <i>character and situation</i>.</p>

<p>1. The <i>character</i> of the Apostles, was that
of plain, uneducated, illiterate men; men,
totally unacquainted with the world, and with
those arts, which are necessary to conduct a
great design with ability and success; men, of
good sense, indeed, and of honest minds, but,
from their singular simplicity, only qualified to
report what they had seen or heared, and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
no means provident or skillful enough to round
and complete a scheme, but half-disclosed by
its author, and that half delivered incidentally
and by parcels to them, and ill understood.</p>

<p>Yet to these men, Jesus declares, that much
was wanting to the integrity of that religious
system, which they were appointed to teach:
and that all defects in it were to be supplied
not by himself, but by a <i>divine spirit</i>, who
should hereafter descend upon them, and <small>LEAD
THEM INTO ALL THE TRUTH</small><a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>; nay, who should
not only instruct them in such parts of his
religion, as he had imperfectly, not at all,
explained, but should, further, open to their
view I know not what scenes of futurity, and
<small>SHEW THEM THINGS TO COME</small>.</p>

<p>These magnificent promises, you see, were
likely to make a deep impression on the rude
minds of the disciples; half-astonished, we
may suppose, at the idea of such superior privileges,
and more than half-intoxicated with
the conceit of that pre-eminence, which those
privileges were to bestow.</p>

<p>Their implicit faith, too in a beloved and
revered Master, would incline them to expect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
with assurance, the completion of these promises:
And thus, every principle, whether of
simplicity, vanity, or credulity, would make
their presumption violent, and leave it without
controul.</p>

<p>2. If we turn, next, to the <i>situation</i> of these
men, buoyed up with such exalted hopes and
expectations, we shall find it apt to create a fanaticism,
which, of itself, might drive them,
in the absence of their politic Master, into
any excess. These simple, over-weening men
were, at the same time, poor, friendless, despised,
insulted, persecuted; exposed to every
injury from the number, power, and malice of
their enemies, as Jesus indeed, had honestly
forewarned them; yet stung with the desire of
founding a temporal kingdom (contrary, it
must be owned, to his express declaration) and
of rising themselves to the first honours of it.
Could any thing flatter their ambition more,
than to be told that they had the modelling of
their own scheme left to themselves, under the
cover of a supernatural direction? Or, could
any thing gratify their resentments, all on fire
from ill usage, more effectually, than to be assured
that the fates of their adversaries, all the
secrets of futurity, lay open to their view?
How oft has oppression turned faith into fanaticism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
and made prophets of those, whom it
only found zealots! And do we think that secular
ambition, concurring with religious zeal,
in the like circumstances, could have any other
issue; especially, when the prophetic impulse
was looked for by such zealots, and, on the
highest authority, actually engaged to them?
Or can we, who see the probability, the certainty,
of this consequence, conceive so meanly
of Jesus, considered in the view of a wise man
only, as to imagine that He should not be
aware of it?</p>

<p>As then it is very unlikely that any politic
impostor should make such a promise, as the
text contains, a promise liable to be abused by
<i>any</i> sort of men, and most of all by <i>those</i>, to
whom it was made; so neither is it conceivable
that, if a rash enthusiast had authorized his
followers to rely on such a promise, the issue
of it could have been that, which we certainly
know it to have been.</p>

<p>For consider, what were the additions, made
to the scheme of Jesus by his enlightened followers,
and what the prophecies delivered by
them? Only, such additions, as served to open
and display the scheme of the Gospel, in a
manner that perfectly corresponded with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
declared views of its author, or at least no way
contradicted them: And only, such prophecies,
as have either been clearly fulfilled, or not convicted
of imposture, to this day.</p>

<p>Then, again, those additions, were directly
contrary to the preconceived notions and expectations,
of those who made them; such, for
instance, as the doctrines concerning <i>the rejection
of the Jews</i>, <i>the call of the Gentiles</i>,
<i>the abolition of the Mosaic ritual</i>, and <i>the
spirituality of Christ’s kingdom</i>; doctrines,
which, in the life-time of their Master, and till
enlightened by the promised Spirit of truth,
they had either not understood, or had rejected
as false and incredible; yet doctrines, which
made the principal part of those <i>truths</i>, into
which they were <i>led by the Spirit</i>.</p>

<p>And as to the prophecies, delivered by them,
what less could one expect from so general,
and so flattering a promise, than that they
should be <i>numerous</i>, and, at the same time,
replete with <i>presages of good fortune</i> to
themselves and their party, and with <i>terrible
denunciations of wrath</i> against their opposers?
Yet nothing of all this followed. The predictions,
they gave out, were indeed so many
as to shew that the promise was performed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
them; yet, on the whole, but <i>few</i>; in truth,
much fewer than can be imagined without a
particular inquiry into the number of them:
And of these few, the greater part were employed
in declaring the corruptions, that
should hereafter be made of the new religion,
they were teaching, and the disasters that
should befall the teachers of it; and scarce
<i>one</i>, directed against their present and personal
enemies.</p>

<p>All this is astonishing, and unaccountable
an the common principles of human nature,
if left to itself in the management of such a
faculty as that of prophetic inspiration. And,
though, on these principles, it was to be supposed,
nay, might certainly have been concluded,
that a set of the craftiest impostors, or
of the honestest fanatics, that ever lived, must,
in the end, dishonour themselves by the exercise
of such a power, and defeat their own
purpose; yet, to the surprize of all reflecting
men, they have maintained, to this day, their
character of veracity, not one of their prophecies
having fallen to the ground; and, what is
more, with so many chances against the success
of their cause, they have triumphed over
all opposition, and have established in the
world a new religion with that force of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
evidence, which, as their Master divinely foretold,
<i>all their adversaries have not been able
to gainsay</i>.</p>

<p>In a word, the <small>EVENT</small> has been, and is such,
as might be expected, if the divine assistance
promised, was actually imparted to them; but
improbable in the highest degree, or rather
impossible to have taken place, if fraud, or
enthusiasm, had been concerned, either in
giving, or fulfilling, this promise.</p>

<p>It would be equally an abuse of your patience,
and an affront to your good sense, to
enlarge farther on so plain a point. From recollecting,
and laying together, the circumstances,
which have been now briefly touched,
and pointed out to you, ye will conclude,
That, when Jesus gave this extraordinary <i>promise</i>
of the Spirit to his followers, he certainly
knew, that he should be able to make good his
engagements to them: And that this <i>spirit</i>,
being of God, would not be at the command
of his followers, to be employed by them, as
their passions, or short-sighted policies, might
direct; but would operate in them, according
to the good pleasure and unerring wisdom of
<small>HIM</small>, who sent this celestial guide; or, in the
words of the text, <i>that he should not speak of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
himself, but whatsoever he should hear, that</i>,
only, <i>he should speak</i>.</p>

<p>No ill effects would, then, proceed from the
privilege of being let into <i>new truths</i>, or, of
being entrusted with the power of foretelling
<i>things to come</i>. And, from the very consideration,
that Jesus had <i>engaged</i> to confer such
privileges upon his disciples, who, if not over-ruled
in the use of them, that is, if not truly
and immediately inspired, would, or rather
must, have employed them to the discredit
and subversion of his own design; from this
single consideration, I say, it may fairly be
concluded, especially when we can now compare
the assurance with the event, That He
himself was the person, he assumed to be, that
is, <small>A DIVINE PERSON</small>; and his religion, what
we believe it to be, <small>THE WORD AND WILL OF
GOD</small>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Acts</span> i. 11.</h3>

<p><i>Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up
into heaven? This same Jesus, which is
taken up from you, shall so come, in like
manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">As</span> the entrance of Jesus into the world, so
his departure out of it, was graced, by the
ministry of angels. Events, so important as
these, deserved, and, it seems, required, to
be so dignified. His birth was, indeed, obscure
and mean; and therefore the attendance
of those <i>flaming ministers</i> might be thought
necessary to illustrate and adorn it. But his
ascension into heaven was an event so full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
glory, that it needed not, we may think, any
additional lustre to be thrown upon it by this
celestial appearance. For what so likely to
raise the ideas and excite the admiration of
those, who were witnesses of this event, as the
fact itself, so sublimely and yet so simply related
in these words of the sacred historian—<i>while
they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud
received him out of their sight</i>?</p>

<p>We may presume, then, that the heavenly
host were not sent merely to dignify this transaction,
in its own nature so transcendently
awful; but for some further purpose of divine
Providence. And we find that purpose expressed
very plainly in the words of the text;
which contain an admonition of great importance,
and direct the attention of the disciples
to the true end, for which this scene of
wonder was displayed before them. For <i>while
they looked stedfastly toward heaven, as he
went up, two men stood by them in white apparel;
which, also, said, Ye men of Galilee,
why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This
same Jesus which is taken up from you into
heaven, shall so come, in like manner as ye
have seen him go into heaven.</i></p>

<p>The Apostles, we may suppose, were only
occupied with the splendor of the shew; or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
they were wholly absorbed in the contemplation
of its miraculous nature; or they were
speculating, perhaps, on the circumstances of
it. They were asking themselves, as they gazed
(at least, if they had possessed the philosophic
spirit of our days, they might be tempted to
ask), how the natural gravity of a human body
could permit its ascent in so light a medium—how
a cloud, which is but a sheet of air, impregnated
with vapours, and made visible by
reflected light, could be a fit vehicle of a gross
and ponderous substance, and serve for the
conveyance of it into the purer regions of æther,
which we call <i>heaven</i>—or, what need indeed
there was, that Jesus should be carried up
thither; as if the God, to whom he ascended,
were not in every place, alike; as if there were
any such distinction, as high and low, with
regard to him; as if all space were not equally
inhabited by an infinite spirit; and as if his
throne were not in the depths beneath, as well
as the heights above, every where, in short,
without respect to our descriptions of place,
where himself existed.</p>

<p>From such a state of mind, or from such
meditations as these, the Angels divert the
Apostles, and call off they attention to a point,
which deserved it better, and concerned them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
more nearly. ’Tis, as if they had said, “Suspend
your admiration of this glorious spectacle;
suppress all your fond and useless speculations
about the causes of this event, and learn
from us the proper uses of it. Ye have seen
your Master thus visibly carried up from you
into heaven; by what means, ye need not
know, and may well forbear to inquire. But
this intelligence receive from us (and it much
imports you to be made acquainted with it);
this same Jesus, who is thus gone up from you
for a time into heaven, will come again with
the same, or even additional glory, to judge
the world in righteousness; to see what improvements
ye have made of all he has done
and suffered for you; and to fix your final
doom according to your respective deserts, or
miscarriages. Think well of this instruction,
which so naturally results from all he said
while he was with you on earth, and from what
has now passed before your eyes; drop all
your other inquiries, and resolve them into
this, above all, deserving your best attention,
how ye may prepare yourselves for that day,
when <i>he shall so come, in like manner as ye
have seen him go into heaven</i>.”</p>

<p>The weight of this angelic admonition was
enough to put all curious imaginations to flight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
and to convince the Apostles then, and all
believers at this day, “That their true wisdom
consists in adverting to the moral and practical
uses of their religion, instead of indulging
subtle, anxious, and unprofitable speculations
concerning the articles of it; such especially as
are too high, or too arduous for them; such,
as they have no real interest in considering, and
have no faculties to comprehend.”</p>

<p>Permit me then to enforce this conclusion,
by applying it to the case of such persons, and
especially of such Christians, as have been, at
all times, but too ready to sacrifice conduct to
speculation; to neglect the ends of religious
doctrines, while they busy themselves in nice
and fruitless and (therefore, if for no other
reason) pernicious inquiries into the grounds
and reasons of them.</p>

<p>1. In the days of ancient paganism, two
points in which religion was concerned, chiefly
engaged the attention of their wise men; “<small>GOD</small>,”
and the “<small>HUMAN SOUL</small>:” interesting topics
both; and the more necessary to be well considered,
because those wise men had little or
no light on these subjects, but what their own
reason might be able to strike out for them.
And, had they been contented to derive, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
the study of God’s works, <i>all that may be
known of him</i>, by natural reason, <i>his eternal
power and Godhead</i>, and had then glorified
him with such a worship, as that knowledge
obviously suggested; or, had they, by adverting
to their own internal constitution, deduced
the spirituality of the soul, together with its
free, moral, and accountable nature, and then
had built on these principles, the expectation
of a future life, and a conduct in this, suitable
to such expectation; had they proceeded thus
far in their inquiries, and stopped here, who
could have blamed, or, rather, who would not
have been ready to applaud, their interesting
speculations. But, when, instead of this reasonable
use of their understandings in religious
matters, they were more curious to investigate
the essence of the infinite mind, than to establish
just notions of his moral attributes; and
to define the nature of the human soul, than to
study its moral faculties; their metaphysicks
became presumptuous and abominable: they
reasoned themselves out of a superintending
providence, in this world, and out of all hope,
in a future; they resolved God into fate, or
excluded him from the care of his own creation,
and so made the worship of him, a matter of
policy, and not of conscience; while, at the
same time, they dismissed the Soul into air, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
into the spirit of the world, either extinguishing
its substance, or stripping it of individual
consciousness; and so, in either way, set aside
the concern, which it might be supposed to
have in a future state, to the subversion of all
morality, as well as of religion.</p>

<p>Such was the fruit of pagan ingenuity! The
philosophers kept <i>gazing</i> upon God, and the
Soul, till they lost all just and useful conceptions
of either: And thus, as St. Paul says, <i>they
became vain in their imaginations; and their
foolish heart was darkened</i><a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.</p>

<p>If from the Grecian, we turn to the oriental,
and what is called, barbaric philosophy, what
portentous dreams do we find about angels and
spirits, or of two opposite principles, contending
for mastery in this sublunary world; ingeniously
spun out into I know not what fantastic
conclusions, which annihilate all sober piety, or
subvert the plainest dictates of moral duty? So
true is it of all presumptuous inquirers into the
invisible things of God, that, <i>professing themselves
wise, they become fools</i>!</p>

<p>But these extravagancies of the heathen world
deserve our pity, and may admit of some excuse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
The worst is, that, when Heaven had revealed
of itself what it saw fit, this irreverent humour
of searching into the deep things of God, was
not cured, but indeed carried to a greater, if
possible, at least to a more criminal excess;
as I shall now shew in a slight sketch of the
mischiefs, which have arisen, from this audacious
treatment even of the divine word.</p>

<p>2. Of the <i>Jewish</i> corruptions I shall say nothing,
because they did not so directly spring
from a licence of speculation in the Rabbins:
though their readiness in admitting unauthorized
traditions, and in giving way to evasive
glosses on the Law, had something of the
same character in it, and led to the same ill
effects.</p>

<p>But when the <i>Gospel</i>, that last and best
revelation of the divine will, was vouchsafed to
mankind, it might be expected, that the most
curious would keep themselves within the
bounds of modesty and respect: that they
would thankfully receive the information imparted
to them, would improve it to its right
use, and acquiesce in the want of that light,
which it was not thought proper to give.</p>

<p>But, no; the same ungoverned curiosity,
that had wantoned so long in the schools of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
pagan philosophy, rioted, with a still more luxuriant
extravagance, in the Christian church:
as if that unholy flame had catched new strength
from the fires of the altar; and the revealed
articles of our creed had been only so much
fresh fuel to feed and augment it.</p>

<p>Hence, in the days of the Apostles themselves,
we hear much of men that, <i>strove about
words, to no profit</i>—of <i>profane and vain babblings</i>,
that tended to nothing but <i>ungodliness</i><a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>,
of arrogant reasoners, who <i>intruded
into those things, which they had not seen,
vainly puft up by their fleshly minds<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>, of</i> extravagant
speculatists, who allegorized and explained
away the fundamental articles of the
faith, even the <i>resurrection</i> itself<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>: which, in
the literal sense, was rejected as a gross doctrine,
not suited to the apprehensions of wise
men.</p>

<p>Thus the seeds of this evil were early sown,
and began to shoot up in those rank heresies,
of which a full harvest presently appeared.</p>

<p>The Gnostic and Manichæan impieties led
the way. Others, of as ill name, followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
from all quarters; especially from the sects of
pagan philosophy; which now pressed into the
church, and, in their haste, forgot to leave
their quibbles and their metaphysicks behind
them. The evidences of the Gospel had, indeed,
extorted their assent: but how ill prepared
they were for the practice of the new religion,
sufficiently appeared, when, instead of
submitting themselves to the word of God,
they would needs torture it into a compliance
with their own fancies. Every convert found
his own tenets in the doctrine of Jesus: and
would be a Christian only, on the principles of
his pagan theology.</p>

<p>Thus the pure and simple faith of the Gospel
was adulterated by every folly, which delirious
reason could invent and propagate; till,
instead of <i>joy and peace in believing</i>, the destined
fruits of Christianity <i>through the power
of the holy Ghost</i><a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>, all was dissonance and distraction:
contentious pride, and fierce inexorable
debate.</p>

<p>These mischiefs continued very long; when
Plato, at one time, and Aristotle, at another,
gave the law to the Christian world; and decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
in all questions, or rather confounded all,
which the subtlety of human wit could extract
from the plainest articles of the Christian
faith.</p>

<p>Even the barbarous ages could not suppress
this fatal ingenuity. The wits of the school-men
teemed with fresh chimæras, in the shade
of their cloysters; as the minds of disturbed
visionaries are observed to be more than commonly
active and prolific in the dark.</p>

<p>At length Reason grew ashamed of these
more than fruitless altercations: and a few
divine men, at the Reformation, seemed resolved
to take the scriptures for their guide, and to
shut up all their inquiries in a frank and full
submission to the written word. Still their
former bad habits, imperceptibly almost, stuck
close to them; for which they had only this
excuse to make, that the zeal of their opponents
forced them into dispute. Necessity, sharpened
their invention; their successes, begot
pride; and persecution, engendered hate. In
this way, and by these steps, it was, that the
Protestants grew ingenious and dogmatical. In
opposition to the church of Rome, they would
explain doctrines, of which they had no just
ideas; founded on texts of Scripture, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
they did not understand. Presently, as was
natural for men in their blind situation, they
quarrelled among themselves; and their presumption,
we may be sure, was not lessened,
but increased, by this misadventure. The issue
of all these conflicts was, an inundation of
dark and dangerous writings, on subjects<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>,
which confound human reason, and in which
religion has no concern.</p>

<p>In process of time, however, these evils were,
in part, removed. Philosophers<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> examined
the scriptures with care, and explained them
with reverence: and, what is more, Divines<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
became, in the best sense of the word, philosophers.
Between them, much light was thrown
on the general scheme of revelation. Its utility,
its necessity, was shewn: its sublime views
were opened: its evidences were cleared: its
doctrines, vindicated: and its authority, maintained.
Reason saw to distinguish between its
own province, and that of faith: It grew severe
in exacting its own rights: and modest in
prescribing to those of the revelation itself.</p>

<p>But while men of superior sense were thus
intent on reforming the bad theology of former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
times, the rest were too generally involved in it.
They were unwilling to give up their darling
habit <i>of gazing up into heaven</i>: that is, of
framing, or adopting theories, which had
neither solidity, nor use; and of explaining
mysteries, which they could not understand<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>.</p>

<p>Nor was the effect of this folly, merely to
disgrace themselves. Christianity was too frequently
seen in the false light, in which these
rash adventurers had placed it: And men of
shallow minds, and libertine principles, were
ready enough to take advantage of all their
indiscretions. For on this ground only, or
chiefly, the various structures of modern infidelity
stand. The presumptuous positions of
particular men, or churches, are forwardly
taken for the genuine doctrines of Christianity:
And those positions, being not unfrequently
either wholly unintelligible, or even contrary to
the plainest reason, the charge of nonsense, or
of falshood, is, thus, dexterously transferred on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
the Gospel itself. And, though the abuse be
gross and palpable, yet, when dressed out with
a shew of argument, or varnished over with a
little popular eloquence, it shall easily pass on
ill-inclined, or unwary men.</p>

<p>It is surely time for us to benefit by this sad
experience. We, the teachers of religion,
should learn, not to be <i>wise above what is
written</i>: And you, who would profit in this
school, should not think much to restrain your
curiosity within these bounds, which, not the
Scriptures only, but, right reason prescribes.</p>

<p>For let it not be surmized, that, in deducing
this account of the mischiefs, which have
sprung from ill-directed inquiries into religion,
my purpose is in any degree to discountenance
the use of reason in such matters. Christianity,
if it be indeed divine, will bear the strictest
examination; and it is the prerogative of our
protestant profession to support itself on the
footing of free inquiry. The way of argument
is so far from being hurtful to the cause of revelation,
that it is, in truth, the basis and
foundation of it. We dishonour, we affront
our holy faith, if we believe it hath, or can
have any other. Only let us take heed, that
Reason do her proper work; and that we do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
not dream, or fancy, or presume, when we
think we reason.</p>

<p>In the instances, before given, the fault was
in concluding without premises, and in arguing
without ideas. When men call this <i>reasoning</i>,
they forget the meaning of the term, as well as
mistake the extent of their own faculties. We
cannot reason on all subjects, because there
are many subjects which we cannot understand:
And by the term, <i>reasoning</i>, is only meant
an act of the mind, which draws right conclusions
from intelligible propositions. The
nature of the infinite Being, the mode of his
existence, the œconomy of his providence, are
inscrutable to us, and probably to the highest
angels. Why then intrude into such things,
as no man hath seen, or can see? All that remains
is, to admit no proposition, which is
not clearly revealed; and, for the rest, to admit,
on the authority of the revealer, what must
be true, though we cannot, in the way of reason,
perceive that it is so.</p>

<p>The inutility of all researches into divine
things, without a strict adherence to this well-grounded
principle, is apparent; the presumption
of them, is ridiculous; but, above all,
the mischiefs of them, are deplorable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

<p>Men bewilder themselves, in inextricable
difficulties: they disbelieve, on incompetent
grounds: they give up the Gospel, and, with
it, their best hopes, for the gratification of the
idlest vanity: or they mis-spend their time in
exploring articles of faith, instead of attending,
to the obvious end and use of them.</p>

<p>To return to the text, which led us into
these reflexions. The disciples were <i>looking
up into heaven</i>, when they should have been
considering how to follow him thither. Is not
our folly the same, or rather is it not more
inexcusable, when gazing, with our weak
reason, on celestial things, we neglect the ends,
for which a glympse of them is afforded to us?
For there is not an article of our creed, which
may not make us better, if not wiser: And
obedience, that is, <i>faith working by love</i>,
whatever some may think, is of another value
in the sight of God, and of higher concern to
man, than all knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his
mother called Mary? And his brethren,
James and Joses and Simon and Judas?
And his sisters, are not they all with us?
Whence then hath this man all these things?
And they were offended in him.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">We</span> have, in these words, a striking picture
of <small>ENVY</small>; which makes us unwilling to
see, or to acknowledge, any pre-eminence in
those, whom we have familiarly known and
conversed with, and whom we have been long
used to regard as our inferiors, or, at most,
but on a level with ourselves. Our Lord’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
neighbours and countrymen, who had been
acquainted with him from his youth, could
repeat the names of his whole family, and
knew the ordinary condition, in which they
lived, were out of patience to think that, so
descended and so circumstanced, he should be
grown at once into distinction among them,
and should be taken notice of for abilities
and powers, which they, none of them, possessed.</p>

<p>This temper of mind, I say, is here very
graphically expressed; and it operated among
the Jews with a more than common malignity,
shedding its venom on those, whom not their
own industry, but the special favour of Heaven
had raised above their fellows, and had commissioned
to go forth with extraordinary powers
(of which they had frequent instances in their
history) for the common benefit of themselves
and of mankind. Whence it acquired even
the authority of a proverbial sentence,—that <i>a
prophet hath no honour in his own country,
and in his own house</i><a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.</p>

<p>But, I mean not to enlarge, at present, on
this moral topick. There is <i>another</i>, and very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
important use to be made of these words, which
is, to let us see, “how very small a matter
will serve to overpower the strongest evidence
of our religion, though proposed with all
imaginable advantage to us, when we <i>hate to
be reformed</i>, or, for any other reason, have
no mind to be convinced of its truth.”</p>

<p>This strange power of <i>prejudice</i> is exemplified
in the text, and will deserve our serious
consideration.</p>

<p>Our blessed Lord had now given many
proofs of the divine virtue, that was lodged in
him; and was, therefore, moved, not only by
the duty of his office, but, as we may suppose,
by that regard which every good man hears to
his country, to make a tender of his mercies to
those persons, especially, among whom he
had been brought up. Accordingly, we are
told, that he came to his own city of Nazareth,
and <i>preached in their Synagogue, insomuch
that</i> the people of that place <i>were
astonished, and said, whence hath this man
this wisdom</i>, which appears in his doctrine,
<i>and these mighty works</i>, which we have seen
him perform? And then, calling to mind the
mean circumstances of his birth and family,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
before repeated, they expressed their dissatisfaction,
or, as the text says, <i>were offended in
him</i>.</p>

<p>But, were those circumstances a reason for
rejecting a <i>doctrine</i>, which astonished them
with its wisdom; and <i>works</i>, which they
owned to be <i>mighty</i>, and above the common
power of man? Rather, sure, the opposite conduct
was to be expected; and, because they
knew certainly, from the mean extraction and
education of him who taught and did these
things, that he had no means of <i>acquiring</i> his
abilities (if they were at all to be acquired) in
an ordinary way, they ought, methinks, to
have had their minds impressed with a full
assurance, that they were owing, as they were
by himself ascribed, to the power of God.</p>

<p>But, no: rather than admit a conclusion,
which hurt their pride, and crossed their
foolish prejudices, they stifle the strongest conviction
of their own minds; and resolve not to
receive a prophet, whom they had long desired
and expected, who came to them with all the
credentials of a prophet, and with the offer of
what they most wanted, the remission of their
sins, and the inestimable gift of eternal life.
And all this, because the prophet was <i>the son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
of a carpenter</i>, in their own town, and because
his <i>brethren and sisters</i>, persons of a
mean condition, <i>were all with them</i>.</p>

<p>When we contemplate such a conduct, as
this, we are ready to say, that it sprung from
a more than common perverseness of character,
and that the people of Nazareth were more
unreasonable and sottish, as the common
proverb made them to be, than the rest of
<i>Israel</i><a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, if we turn our thoughts on the other
tribes and cities of that nation, on the inhabitants
of Judæa, and even of Jerusalem, we
shall find, that they reasoned no better than
the men of Nazareth had done; and discovered
equal, indeed, much the same prejudices as
those, by which our Lord’s own countrymen
had been misled.</p>

<p>For, what else was it to say, as they commonly
did, that <i>no prophet could come out of
Galilee</i><a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>; that he could not be the Messiah,
because his disciples were illiterate fishermen<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>,
and not Scribes and Pharisees; because none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
of their rulers believed on him<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>; because he
conversed, sometimes, with publicans and sinners<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>;
because he did not observe their minute
ceremonies or traditions<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>; because he manifested
his divine power in healing the sick, and
casting out devils, and not in breaking to pieces
the Roman empire and restoring the temporal
kingdom of Israel<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>; because—but I need
not instance in more particulars: Universally,
the Jews, of all places and denominations, rejected
their Lord and Saviour for reasons, the
most absurd and trivial; for reasons, that came
from the heart, and not the head, which shewed
they were under the power of some contemptible
prejudice, and would yield to no evidence, unless
that was complied with.</p>

<p>Still, “the Jews, in general, you will say,
were unlike other people. Tell us how the
polished Heathens reasoned on the subject of
Christ’s mission; and whether, when the Gospel
was addressed to them, they opposed it on
the footing of those senseless prejudices, which
you have enough disgraced.”</p>

<p>Luckily, I have it in my power to accept
this challenge; and to shew you, on the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
authority, that those men of enlightened minds
and renowned wisdom were as weak in their
sophisms, and as childish in their cavils against
the new religion, as the Jews themselves.</p>

<p>We read in the Acts of the Apostles<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>, that
St. Paul came to Ephesus, a rich, learned,
idolatrous city of Asia; that he applied himself
more especially to the instruction of its
Gentile inhabitants; <i>disputing daily, for two
years together, in the school of one Tyrannus</i>,
a teacher of rhetorick, or philosophy, as we
may suppose, and a convert to the faith of
Jesus. That his success was great, we may
conclude, both from his long residence, and
from <i>the special miracles</i>, which he wrought,
among them. Yet, when <i>the word of God
had grown mightily and prevailed, a certain
silver-smith, who made silver shrines</i> for the
Goddess of the place, had credit enough with
this well instructed city, because its trade was
likely to suffer by the downfall of idolatry, to
raise such an uproar among the people, that
the Apostle’s labours were, at once, overturned
by this powerful argument, and he, himself,
compelled to leave them to their old infatuations:
which was much such treatment, as
Jesus himself had received from the Gadarenes;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
who, because he had permitted the devils,
ejected out of one of their people, to enter into
a herd of swine, and to destroy them, would
not be saved at this expence, and required him,
but civilly indeed, <i>to depart out of their coasts</i>.
Now, was that <i>craft</i>, or this <i>husbandry</i>, a
matter to be put in competition with the saving
of their souls, which they had reason to expect
from the preaching of Paul and Jesus? Or, is
it not clear, that a petty interest, that is, a
sordid <i>prejudice</i>, prevailed against the most
precious hopes, supported by the fullest evidence?</p>

<p>But these were <i>prejudices</i> of the ignorant
vulgar. Let us see, then, what success St. Paul
had in a nobler scene, among wits and sages,
men of refined sense and reason, in the head-quarters
of politeness and civility, in the eye of
Greece itself, in one word, Athens<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>. Here,
the great Apostle, who had the charity, and
the ability, to <i>make himself all things to all
men</i>, encountered their ablest philosophers;
reasoning with them, even before their revered
court of Areopagus, on their own favourite
topics of <i>God, and the Soul</i>, in a strain of argument,
which was clearly unanswerable; and
concluding his weighty apology with <i>Jesus and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
the Resurrection</i>. But what was the effect of
all this truth on the minds of these liberal heathens?
Why the text says—<i>when they
heared of the resurrection of the dead, some</i>
(that is, the Epicureans) <i>mocked</i>; and why?
because their philosophy admitted no future
state: while <i>others</i> (the Stoics) <i>said, We will
hear thee again of this matter</i>; but, for as poor
reason, as the other, because their philosophy
taught I know not what of a certain renovation
of the world, which, for the credit of their sect,
they were half inclined to confound with the
Christian resurrection. You see, in both parties,
the power of prejudice; where yet the
occasion was the most interesting, the hearers
the most capable, the ability or the speaker,
independently of his assumed inspiration, unquestionably
great, and where the conclusion,
(so carelessly dismissed) was, after all, a question
of <small>FACT</small>, which had no dependance on the
fanciful tenets of either party.</p>

<p>I should weary you and myself, should I
carry on this deduction through the following
ages of the Christian church; and shew, as I
might easily do, that the ablest men of science,
who opposed Christianity, did it on grounds
no better than those of these Athenian sophists.
We see what these grounds were, in the fragments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
that remain to us, of many ancient unbelievers<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>,
men, the most acute and learned of
their times; while yet every man of sense, that
now reads and considers their objections, will
own, whether he be himself a Christian or not,
that they are altogether weak and frivolous,
and have the face not so much of sound, or
even colourable arguments, as of faint and
powerless prepossessions against unwelcome
truth.</p>

<p>I shall only instance in <i>one</i> of these prepossessions,
which you think prodigious.
The Roman empire, labouring under its own
vices, and many <i>physical</i> evils, which then lay
heavy upon it, experienced, in the fourth century,
that reverse of fortune, which, in its turn,
the greatest nations must expect. But by this
time Christianity had spread itself through all
the provinces, and was become the religion of
the state. In these circumstances, the Heathens,
very generally, not the rabble only, but
the gravest and wisest of the Heathens; ascribed
these disasters to the abolition of idolatry;
and thought it an unanswerable argument
against the faith of Jesus, that it did not
maintain their empire in that degree of splendour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
and prosperity, to which, in the days of
pagan worship, it had happily been raised.
And this miserable superstition, which we now
only pity, or, perhaps, smile at, made so deep
an impression on the minds of men, that the
greatest of the ancient fathers, and particularly
St. Austin<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>, were scarce able, with all their
learning and authority, to bring it into
contempt.</p>

<p>Such was the power of <i>ancient</i> prejudice
against the Christian religion. But I hasten to
set before you, in few words, what its tyranny
has been in <i>later</i> times.</p>

<p>The accidental and temporary commotions,
which reformed religion produced in our western
world, furnished in the minds of many, a
notable <i>argument</i> against the cause of Protestantism,
which, when taken up and improved,
as it soon was, by state-policy, had, indeed, a
fatal influence on its success. But, even as to
Christianity itself, that day-spring of knowledge,
which broke upon us at the Reformation,
and, as they say, has been brightening from
that time to this, could not disperse those phantoms
of prejudice, which are forever haunting
the human mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

<p>Men, who piqued themselves on their sagacity,
presently started up, and said, that, because
popery had been found to be an imposture,
Christianity was so too; and because the legendary
tales of the cloysters had been convicted of
falshood, that the Scriptures themselves deserved
but little regard. And when afterwards
these suspicions gave way to sober criticism and
learned inquiry, <i>prejudices</i> still arose, in
various shapes, against the <small>EVIDENCES</small>, and the
<small>DOCTRINES</small> of the Gospel-Revelation. We were
told, that the <i>prophecies</i> proved nothing, because
some of them were too obscure, and
others too plain. Could both these objections
come from the oracle, Reason? Or, is it so
much as likely, that either of them did so?
when, for any thing it could tell, both the
clearness, and the obscurity might be suitable
to the occasion, and each, be fit, in its place.
Then again, there were others bold enough to
deny the existence of <i>miracles</i>, not, because
many have been forged, but because none can be
true. Was this, too, the voice of Reason? or,
is not St. Paul’s appeal to common sense enough
to disgrace this fancy to the end of the world—<i>Why
should it be thought a thing incredible
with you that</i> <small>GOD</small> <i>should raise the dead</i>?<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
God, who surely has <i>power</i> to do this, or other
miracles, when his <i>wisdom</i> sees fit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p>The <i>contents</i> of the Gospel have also been
treated, I do not say with as little respect, but
with as little shew of reason and argument, as
the evidences of it.</p>

<p>For instance, it was current, not long ago,
that “Christianity was as old as the Creation;”
the meaning of which wise saying was, that
Christianity could not be true, because the
<i>moral</i> part of it was such, as nature taught, and
had at all times been able to discover by its own
light. Admit the fact: what follows? That
therefore a divine revelation needs not repeat
and could not occasionally enforce the laws of
nature. Is reason, pure unmixed reason,
accustomed to trifle at this rate?</p>

<p>But the complaint now is, that nature does
not teach the <i>doctrinal</i> part of the Gospel.
And what then? Was it not equally to be expected
that what concerns the essence and
counsels and dispensations of God should be a
secret to nature, unassisted by revelation, as
that our practical moral duties should lie open
to its view? And, if the force of this question
be not generally felt, there is no doubt, I
think, but it will, in a short time. For, it is
to be observed of all these idle cavils, that they
presently vanish one after another; and, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
each has had its day, is, thenceforth, exploded
even by unbelievers themselves.</p>

<p>But, ’tis time to come to a conclusion of this
matter. The purpose of all I have said is, only,
this, to shew, what weak and idiot prejudices
have, at all times, been taken up against
Christianity, and how generally they have
been mistaken by the acutest of its enemies,
for reasons of much weight.</p>

<p>And, if all, who hear me, be led by this experience,
to suspect the infirmity of their own
minds; if, having seen the disgraceful issue of
so many fancies, which for a time have passed
for shrewd <i>arguments</i>, but have, afterwards,
appeared to be nothing more than childish <i>prejudices</i>,
they can be brought to mistrust those,
that occur to themselves; if, in a word, they
can be induced to question the pertinence and
force of what they too easily consider in the
light of objections to Christianity, and to argue
soberly and cautiously at least, if they will
needs try their skill in arguing against it; the
end, I have in view, will be answered, and
neither my pains, nor your attention, will be
thrown away on this discourse.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">James</span> iv. 7.</h3>

<p>—<i>Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">That</span> there are Angels and Spirits, good
and bad; that, at the head, of these last, there
is <small>ONE</small>, more considerable and malignant, than
the rest, who in the form, or under the name,
of a <i>Serpent</i>, was deeply concerned in the fall
of man, and whose <i>head</i>, as the prophetic language
is, the Son of man was, one day, to
<i>bruise</i>; that this evil spirit, though that prophecy
be, in part, completed, has not yet received
his death’s wound, but is still permitted,
for ends unsearchable to us, and in ways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
which we cannot particularly explain, to have
a certain degree of power in this world, hostile
to its virtue and happiness, and sometimes
exerted with too much success; all this is so
clear from Scripture, that no believer, unless
he be, first of all, <i>spoiled by philosophy and
vain deceit</i>, can possibly entertain a doubt
of it.</p>

<p>The subject, indeed, in its full extent, cannot
be discussed at this time, nor conveniently,
perhaps, in this place. But it may not be
improper to make some general reflexions
upon it; such as may serve to rectify your
<small>APPREHENSIONS</small> of the doctrine itself, which, as
I said, is truly scriptural, and to suggest, at
the same time, the <small>MORAL AND RELIGIOUS
USES</small>, we ought to make of it.</p>

<p>1. An opinion prevailed in the East very
early, and was probably derived from some
still more ancient tradition of the fall, corrupted,
and misunderstood, that two, equally
great and independent beings, a good and a
bad, shared the government of the world between
them; that these beings, of directly opposite
characters, carried on a perpetual war
with each other, crossed each other’s designs
and operations, and, as either prevailed, produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
the good or evil, the happiness or misery,
of this life.</p>

<p>This opinion was, afterwards, taken up by
some, who called themselves Christians; and
was especially applied by those, who loved to
philosophize (as too many did, and, at all
times, have been prone to do) on the secrets
of divine Providence, to the solution of that
great question, concerning the <i>origin of natural
and moral evil</i>.</p>

<p>Now, to this notion some countenance, it is
thought, has been given by the scriptural doctrine
of the Devil, who is spoken of, as <i>the
Prince of this world</i><a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>, as the <i>Prince of the
power of the air</i><a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>, as <i>the God of this world</i><a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>,
and in other terms of the like sort, denoting
as well the <i>power</i>, as malignity, of this evil
Being.</p>

<p>But, though these terms are, some of them,
very strong, and certainly imply, not the
existence only, but the extensive agency and
influence, of this wicked Spirit, yet there is no
pretence or colour for supposing that any thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
like an equality to the God of heaven and
earth, or an independency upon him, was intended
to be expressed by them. For it is manifest,
that no writings in the world exalt our
ideas of that God so high, or set forth his supreme
irresistible and sovereign dominion in so
strong and decisive terms, as the Jewish and
Christian scriptures. And with regard to the
particular evil being under consideration, he is
represented as <i>trembling</i><a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> at the very apprehension
of the omnipotent Creator, as sentenced
by his justice<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>, and reserved for the
execution of it<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>; as exercising a partial, a precarious,
a limited power in this world, working
only in the <i>children of disobedience</i><a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>, and in
them, consequently, no longer than they continue
to deserve that character; and baffled in
his attempts, not only by the Son of God, but
by the <i>resistance</i><a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>, by the <i>prayers</i><a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>, by the
<i>faith</i><a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>, of Christians; as a rebel indeed, yet a
rebel cast out<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> and disabled<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>, and compelled
to be an instrument, like all other things, in
the hands of the Almighty<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p>But nothing shews more clearly, how abhorrent
the spirit of Christianity is from the
Manichæan doctrine, than the care that is
taken throughout the Gospel-history to set
forth the triumphs of Christ over the kingdom
of Satan, in <i>casting out devils</i>; of which the
instances are so many, and so circumstantially
described, as if our Lord’s main or sole purpose
had been to expose and explode that great impiety.
He not only, himself, commanded, by
a word, the devils to go out of the possessed,
who accordingly obeyed him, and, in departing,
deprecated that power<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>, which they knew
he had over them; but he, likewise, gave the
same authority to his disciples, who went forth
with his commission, and <i>returned again with
joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject
unto us, through thy name</i><a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>. On which occasion,
<i>he said unto them</i>, as exulting in his
dominion over the enemy, and in the rapid,
instantaneous, irresistible effect of it, <i>I beheld
Satan, as lightning, fall from heaven</i><a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus much may suffice to shew, that,
though the Gospel affirms the existence of evil
spirits, and of one eminently so, yet that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
gives no countenance to the doctrine of the
two principles; as if the evil one were independent
of the good, or that Satan could have
the madness to think of rivalling the power of
God, and of entering into a direct formal contest,
as it were, with the Almighty. Whatever
of this sort has been said, or insinuated,
contradicts the express testimony, indeed, the
whole tenour, of holy scripture, and is nothing
but poetry, or misrepresentation.</p>

<p>2. Still, on the face of that account, which
Scripture itself gives, it must be owned, that
the power of Satan is great and even dreadful.</p>

<p>That he was permitted, in our Saviour’s
time, to vex, and, in various ways, torment
the <small>BODIES</small> of men, is clear from the number
of <i>possessions</i>, we read of in the Gospel;
which though some have laboured to explain
away (as they have, indeed, the personality of
the Devil himself) by reducing what is said of
his agency to a mere figure of speech, yet I do
not find that their attempts have, hitherto,
been, or are likely to be, successful.</p>

<p>That he was, also, permitted to lay such
trains, and contrive such measures, as had a
fatal effect, sometimes, on the <small>FORTUNES</small> of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
men, not of those only, who were the immediate
instruments of his malice, but of good
and innocent men, who stood at a distance
from him, we see by the sad catastrophe of
that council, which <i>he put into the heart of
Judas to betray his master</i><a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>; first, in the untimely
death of the traitor himself, and then,
by a series of connected events, in the crucifixion
of the holy Jesus; and by several other
instances. And, that he still retains this last
power, as formidable as it truly is, must be
concluded, if it be true, as we shall presently
see it is, that he insinuates himself into the
minds of bad men, and is concerned in exciting
and promoting their wicked purposes.
But, whether he be allowed to tyrannize over
the bodies of men, is more problematical.
That, for any thing we know, he may operate
in the way of <i>possession</i>, I do not see on what
certain grounds any man can deny: that he
does so, I would not affirm, because the Scripture,
our only guide as to what respects the
agency of spirits, is silent in that matter. But
the inquiry is of the less moment, because,
since the gift of <i>discerning</i> spirits hath ceased
in the church, we have no means of distinguishing
between <i>possessions</i> and <i>natural disorders</i>;
and, because, if we had, there is no
known cure, or antidote, for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p>Had this been considered, all the mischiefs
which have arisen from the trade of witchcraft
and diabolism, would have been prevented.
For they have proceeded, not from the supposed
possibility of possessions, but from a
fraudulent pretence of knowing when they take
place, and from a superstitious belief of certain
charms or spells, which may be applied, with
effect, to the removal of them. Whereas, the
fact is not cognizable by us, the symptoms,
whether of the natural disorder, or of the
pretærnatural infliction, being equivocal; and
Christianity acknowledges no power in words,
or ceremonies, to exorcise evil spirits. The
only exorcism, which is now permitted to
Christians, is that of faith and repentance, that
is, of a good life; which every man may, and
should apply, when it is needful, to his own
case, and which, in that application, can surely
do no hurt to himself, or others.</p>

<p>And, with this explanation, I leave the matter
of <i>possessions</i>. As I have no authority to
affirm, that there <i>are</i>, now, any such, so neither
may I presume to say, with confidence,
that there are <i>not</i> any.</p>

<p>But, then, with regard to the influence of
evil spirits at this day upon the <small>SOULS</small> of men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
I shall take leave to be a great deal more peremptory.
For this influence is so constantly
supposed in the Gospel; there are so many admonitions,
cautions, advices, relating to it;
there are so many warnings given us by Christ
and his Apostles against the snares, the wiles,
the devices, the depths, of Satan, and these, conveyed
in the form of general precepts, plainly
calculated for the use of Christians in all ages;
it is so expressly said, in Christ’s own parable of
the sower, that the <i>tares</i>, that is, bad men, <i>are
sown by the devil</i>, and that this husbandry will
be carried on by him to the end of the world;
it is so apparent, that his empire over bad men
is exercised in the way of temptation and seduction,
by putting bad purposes into their
minds, and filling their hearts with corrupt
imaginations and intentions; it is, besides, so
evident that we are continually in danger of
this temptation, by that clause in the Lord’s
prayer, the daily prayer of all Christians—<i>deliver
us from the evil one</i><a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>—for such is the
proper sense of these words, which we translate,
<i>deliver us from evil</i>—All this, I say, is
so manifest to every one who reads the scriptures,
that, if we respect their authority, the
question, concerning the reality of demonic
influence upon the minds of men, is clearly
determined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p>Nay, there are many instances, in history,
and common life, of prodigious, almost unimaginable
wickedness, strangely conceived and
executed, which, if they do not prove this
doctrine, in the way of sensible experience,
perfectly fall in, and harmonize with it. It
seems, as if the soul of some men were demoniacal,
as the bodies of others have been. Let
me appeal to yourselves. Suppose that a person,
duly commissioned for that purpose, had
dislodged as many devils from Nero or Cæsar
Borgia, as our Saviour did from the poor unhappy
man of Gadara, would this exorcism
have surprized you more in the former case,
than the latter? or would not this miracle have
furnished us with a better account, than we
can now give, of the transcendant wickedness,
which <i>possessed</i> the hearts of those monsters?</p>

<p>Indeed, in the simpler ages, our forefathers,
who read the scriptures, and believed what
they read, constantly ascribed any crime, with
which they charged another, to <i>the instigation
of the devil</i>; as you may see from the language
of those forms, which are used, in criminal
prosecutions to this day: and, if those charges
be vow considered as <i>mere forms</i>, it was not
always so; and a better reason will be required,
than can be presently given, why any Christian
should so conceive of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

<p>3. But to all this it be said, “that the
doctrine, here laid down, as scriptural, is
strange and incredible; that it makes the
virtue and happiness of men depend on
others, and not themselves; that it supposes
a power, adverse to the great Creator
and Governor, and able, on many occasions,
to prevail against him, which, degrades both
his <i>sovereignty</i> and his <i>wisdom</i>; and that,
above all, it represents weak simple men as
exposed to the practices of great and subtle
tempters, which overturn all our ideas of the
divine <i>justice</i> and <i>goodness</i>.”</p>

<p>The objection might be expressed in more
words, but you see the drift and force of it.
Now, in answer, it would be enough to say,
that, let the difficulties be what they will, the
doctrine is scriptural. But then, as to those
difficulties themselves, I must further say,
that they are not peculiar to this doctrine,
as revealed in scripture, but bear equally
against the natural doctrine of God’s moral
government.</p>

<p>For do we not see that we all of us depend
in a great measure, for the virtue and happiness
we possess, on the conduct of others?
Can we look about us, and not perceive an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
order of beings, I mean, <i>wicked men</i>, opposing
themselves to the will of God, traversing his
righteous purposes, and prevailing, for a time
at least, against his primary intentions? Do
they not pervert, corrupt, destroy multitudes
every day; and are not the weak and simple
permitted to fall into the snares of the wise
and crafty? Do not these things evidently
take place in our world, and is it thought any
derogation from the attributes of God that
they should be allowed to do so? Are not
men, too oft, a sort of devils to each other,
and can we wonder that vice and misery are
much in the power of such agents? Yes, but
<i>spiritual unseen</i> agents!—Does that make any
mighty difference? Is it necessary to suppose
that <i>spirits</i>, of whatever rank, are privileged
from abusing their free-will, and from being
perverse and wicked, as we see men are? And,
what if they are <i>unseen</i>? Have we reason to
expect, from the present constitution of things,
that we should suffer only from the practices of
known and visible tempters? As if much of
the vice and wretchedness of this life did not
come upon us by surprize, as we may say, and
when we think little of the cause, or the
agent! A lye, flies in the dark, and misleads
many into errors, and even crimes. A libel,
gets abroad, nobody knows from whom, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
yet shall tempt, perhaps drive, unwary multitudes,
into rebellion. How many plots of
wickedness are laid and succeed, when the
plotter is out of sight and not so much as suspected!
Nay, a certain cast of mind, or temperament
of body, things, wholly unknown
and unthought of by most men, shall, without
great care and circumspection, be fatal to our
virtue. Even the air, we breathe, (which,
like the <i>prince of the power of the air</i>, is to
us invisible) has a secret, and yet, sometimes,
powerful influence on our passions. And shall
we still disbelieve the seduction of an evil
spirit, because he steals insensibly upon us?</p>

<p>But the true answer to all objections of this
sort, whether men or devils be the tempters,
is, that neither shall prevail, but by our own
fault, by some carelessness, or wilful corruption
of our own hearts, which are always sufficiently
admonished, that the enemy is at hand,
when evil thoughts, however produced, begin
to stir in them. Then is the time to watch,
and <i>resist</i>: and our resistance, the text tells
us, will not be in vain. And what though
legions of spirits lay siege to us! We may call
<i>more than twelve legions of angels</i>, even the
holy Spirit of God himself, to our assistance, if
we please; for <i>greater is</i> <small>HE THAT IS IN US</small>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
<i>than he that is in the world</i><a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>. So <i>faithful is
God</i>, after all our impious surmises and distrust
of his gracious providence, <i>who will not
suffer us to be tempted above that we are
able</i>, though Satan himself be the tempter,
<i>but will with the temptation also</i>, if we be
careful to do our part, <i>make a way for us to
escape</i><a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>.</p>

<p>4. And this being the case, all objections
to the doctrine here inculcated, fall to the
ground; so that I have only to remind you, in
two words, (for the time will not allow many)
of the <i>moral and religious uses</i>, we ought to
make of it.</p>

<p>I shall but mention <small>ONE</small>, of each sort.</p>

<p>1. In a <small>RELIGIOUS</small> view, the belief of this
doctrine is of the utmost importance: for the
whole scheme of Redemption is founded upon
it. For <i>therefore</i> Christ came into the world,
and suffered upon the cross, <i>that, through
death</i>, as St. Paul says, <i>he might destroy him,
that had the power of death, that is, the</i>
<small>DEVIL</small><a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>. And, universally, <i>for this purpose</i>
(I quote the words of St. John) <i>the Son of
God was manifested, that he might destroy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
the works of the</i> <small>DEVIL</small><a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>. It concerns us,
then, infinitely, to take heed lest, by denying,
or questioning, or explaining away, the existence
and agency of the evil spirit, we subvert
the foundation of our faith, detract from the
glory of our Saviour’s passion, and unthankfully
<i>despise the riches of his goodness</i> in
dying for us: nay, and lest we blaspheme the
Holy Ghost; who was given to <i>help our infirmities</i><a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>,
to <i>strengthen us with might in the
inner man</i><a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>, and therefore to save us, from the
power of <i>that spirit, which worketh in the
children of disobedience</i><a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>.</p>

<p>2. In a <small>MORAL</small> view it is, also, of great importance,
that we entertain right notions on
this subject.</p>

<p>I know that the <i>world</i> and the <i>flesh</i> are
powerful enemies enough, and that we need
not wish to signalize our courage by a contest
with any <i>other</i>.</p>

<p>But if there <i>be</i> another, we are concerned
to know what our danger is, and to provide
against it. Security is generally fatal; especially
when the strength of the enemy is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
greater than we take it to be. Therefore, let
us learn from scripture, what that strength is;
and let us use all diligence in <i>resisting</i> (as we
have long since engaged to do) not the <i>world</i>
and the <i>flesh</i> only, but also, the <small>DEVIL</small>. This
is the advice of the text—<i>Resist the</i> <small>DEVIL</small>.
And then, too, is the advice of the Apostle
Peter—<i>Be sober, be vigilant; become your
adversary, the</i> <small>DEVIL</small>, <i>as a roaring lion,
walketh about, seeking whom he may devour</i><a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
(words, by the way, which put the <i>personality</i>
of the tempter out of all question); <i>Whom resist</i>,
says he, <i>stedfast in the</i> <small>FAITH</small>; under the
protection of which shield, <i>we shall be able to
quench all the fiery darts of</i> <small>THE WICKED</small><a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.</p>

<span class="medium">PREACHED MARCH 29, 1772.</span></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Prov.</span> xvi. 6.</h3>

<p><i>By the fear of the Lord, men depart from
evil.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">All</span> the authority of Solomon’s name and
wisdom will, I doubt, be no more than sufficient
to procure respect to this observation;
which some may consider as a <i>trite and vulgar
truth</i>, scarce deserving their regard; while
others, perhaps, will not so much as allow it
to be a truth at all, but indeed a <i>vulgar mistake</i>,
arising out of the narrow views of ignorant or
superficial declaimers. It may be slighted by
one set of men, as conveying <i>no</i> information,
and by another, as conveying a <i>wrong</i> one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

<p>Let me attempt then to rescue the sacred
text from both these imputations. Permit me
to shew you, that the observation, it contains,
is neither so generally received, as to make all
further discourse about it frivolous and unnecessary;
nor yet, on the other hand, of so
questionable a nature, as to justify the scorn
with which it is sometimes rejected.</p>

<p>I. To those, who are such fastidious hearers
of the word, as to disregard an important truth,
because repeatedly inforced upon them, I might
reply that such truths can never be insisted
upon too much, that our duty is to inculcate
them, <i>in season, and out of season</i>.</p>

<p>But the fact is mistaken. We are so far
from nauseating our hearers, with a too common
and superfluous truth, when we remind
them perpetually, that, <i>by the fear of God,
men depart from evil</i>, that, on the contrary,
very many want to be informed, or at least
convinced, of it.</p>

<p>What the text affirms, is, that the <i>fear of
God</i>, or the <small>RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLE</small>, is the proper
guide of life. But look now into the <i>world</i>, at
large: there the acknowledged rule of life, is
<small>FASHION</small>. Look into the <i>civil or political</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
world: there the boasted rule of life, is <small>THE
LAW OF THE MAGISTRATE</small>. Look into the
<i>learned</i> world: there too commonly the only
rule of life is each man’s own reason, or what
he proudly calls <small>PHILOSOPHY</small>.</p>

<p>And will it now be said that <i>the fear of God</i>,
is a principle too stale and too unquestioned to
be discoursed upon and recommended to you
from this place, when we see so large and so
considerable a part of the world actuated by one
or other of these different and discordant principles?
But neither</p>

<p>II. Is the truth, though far enough from
being generally received, so slightly grounded
as to justify any man in the contempt of it.</p>

<p>It is a truth, taught of God, and revered by
all wise men. It has nature, and reason, and
experience on its side; and is only combated
by the folly, the short-sighted policy, or lastly,
the pride, of half-thinking and presumptuous
men.</p>

<p>For to give, now, the godless principles,
I before mentioned, a short and separate examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

<p>1. Tell <i>the man of the world</i>, that the religious
principle is that by which alone he ought
to govern himself, and you are presently told
of the power and prerogatives of <small>FASHION</small>.</p>

<p>“<i>The fear of God</i>, he will say, may be the
proper rule of monks and hermits; but must
be qualified, at least, in many respects, by such
as live in the world and mix in the society of it.
They who have to converse with mankind, are
to accommodate themselves to their notions and
practices: they are to think with the rest of the
world, or at least they are to act with them:
they are to found their moral systems on the
liberal and enlarged basis of approved use or
custom. Their observation of human life must
inform them of the ways that men take to conciliate
the good will of their fellows, to prosecute
their own advantages in the world, and to
acquire the confidence and esteem of that society,
in which they are stationed. What they
find to be the rule of others, must be a rule to
themselves. To do otherwise is not weakness,
only: It is, besides, arrogance, incivility,
inhumanity.”</p>

<p>All this is thought plausible by some men;
and taken together, it must be owned, forms a
very easy and commodious system: but how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
consistent with conscience, with duty, and
with common sense, they will do well to consider.
For if <i>fashion</i> only be to regulate our conduct
in all cases, I ask not what becomes of
piety, but of humanity itself, I mean of those
offices which we owe to others and to ourselves,
and which reason dictates to us in every situation.
Custom, you will say, is practical reason.
But what! To be led blind-fold by the prevailing
practice, whatever it be, what is it but
to renounce our intelligent nature, and to live
at hazard, and without reason? Further still:
If it be sufficient to do as we see others <i>creditably</i>
do, without examining any farther, we
shall often find ourselves involved, I do not say
in the most irrational, the most inconsistent,
but the most horrid practices. Then, killing
with malice and with forethought, if the point
of honour prevail, will be no <i>murder</i>: And,
adultery, if the law of politeness so ordain,
shall hide its atrocious nature under the mask
of <i>gallantry</i>: Then shall society at large
become a scene of fraud and rapine; good faith,
shall be termed <i>simplicity</i>, and fair dealing,
<i>folly</i>.</p>

<p>Go now, and say that <i>the fear of God</i> is a
needless restraint on free spirits; and count the
advantages which ye have reason to promise to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
yourselves, from acknowledging no other guide
of life, but <i>imperious fashion</i>!</p>

<p>2. A graver set of men come next, and tell
us, “That <i>fashion</i> is indeed a very uncertain
guide of life: But that <small>LAW</small>, the result of the
public wisdom, armed with the public force,
is an adequate rule of human action; that the
legislator’s province is to enact such salutary
laws, and the magistrate’s duty, to carry them
into execution, as shall be sufficient to secure
the peace and order of society; And that every
other rule of life is at once unnecessary and ineffectual:
<i>unnecessary</i>, because the interests
of virtue are amply provided for by the wisdom
of law; and <i>ineffectual</i>, because no other
principle has force enough to exact obedience:
That, in particular, <i>the fear of God</i> is too
remote a consideration to restrain the tumultuous
passions of men, which are held in subjection
by nothing but the instant terrors of
civil justice; in a word, that where the law of
the state is duly enforced, there is no need of
other restraints; and that, lastly, to lay a stress
on <i>the religious principle</i> is to weaken the operation
of law, as it opens a door to fanaticism
and superstition.”</p>

<p>This plea of the politician receives an apparent
force from this certain truth, That law is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
indeed of indispensable necessity, and that the
general virtue and happiness of a people cannot
be maintained without it. We join him therefore
very cordially in this encomium on civil
justice; but must remind him, withal, that
neither is the religious principle superseded by
it, nor can civil justice itself maintain its due
course, without the support of the religious
principle: That, when the authority of law has
done its best, there will be much for religion to
controul and regulate; <i>much</i>, that is not
within the reach of law, and without its jurisdiction:
That <i>the fear of the Lord</i> penetrates
deeper and farther, than the sword of the
magistrate; and that, even within his own
province, all his policy and all his power will
take a very imperfect effect, without the concurrence
of a higher principle; as he himself
is abundantly convinced from the necessity of
fortifying his own most important constitutions,
by the religion of an oath; which is nothing
else but an appeal to the fear of God, under a
sense of its being a needful supplement to the
fear of the magistrate.</p>

<p>Yet society, they say, is entirely upheld by
the authority of law; at least, the world may
go on very well, by virtue of that only. Yes;
It may go on, as we see it does, full of open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
violence, which all its terrors cannot restrain;
and of secret frauds, for which it cannot so
much as project a remedy: It may go on, indeed,
but polluted by vices of all sorts, which
are not the objects of law, and even by crimes,
which are often too strong for it: It may go
on indeed, till the religious principle be quite
effaced from the minds of men (if we may have
leave for a moment, to put so desperate, and,
thank God, so impossible a case); but, when
that dreadful time comes, society itself, with
all its bulwark of laws, must inevitably be
swept away with it.</p>

<p>Universal history bears testimony to this awful
truth; there being no account of any state
on the face of the earth, which could ever support
itself in general virtue, or general happiness,
by the mere force of its civil institutions.
And how should it be otherwise, when the fear
of God is requisite to enforce the law, as well
as to observe it; to supply the state with faithful
magistrates, as well as with obedient
subjects?</p>

<p>If then this vital principle of religion, so necessary
to the conservation of all states, cannot
be kept free from some mixture of fanaticism
or superstition, we are surely to endure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
the inconvenience, as we can, rather than put
the interests of society to hazard by suspending
them all on the weak and false supports of an
irreligious policy.</p>

<p>3. Lastly, the <span class="smcap">PHILOSOPHER’s</span> plea, though
specious at first sight, is of all others the weakest.
For <i>fashion</i>, if it chance to be on the
side of virtue, will be punctually followed:
And the sword of the <i>magistrate</i> can, in part,
at least, enforce obedience. But what coercive
power is there in <i>philosophy</i>? It may see and
determine right: but who, or what shall compell
this supreme directress of life to observe
its own determinations? “The fitness, it may
be said, of those determinations themselves;
the very reason of the thing being the proper
restraint of reasonable natures.” Still the question
returns, What if I am disposed to throw
off this restraint? I act against conviction,
indeed, and am self-condemned, which to a
liberal mind is no small punishment. But
look into the world, and see if that punishment
be sufficient to induce the bulk of mankind,
nay the gross body of philosophers themselves,
<i>to depart from evil</i>.</p>

<p>And what, after all, is this magnified reason?
One man admits no other rule of life but <i>abstract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
truth</i>, or what he calls <i>the differences of
things</i>: Another, will hear of none, but an
instinctive <i>moral sense</i>: And a third, entrenches
himself within the narrow circle of
<i>private happiness</i>. These several systems have
been laid down, each in its turn, as the only
proper basis of moral action: But could the
patrons of them be made to agree in any one;
or could their several schemes be made, as
perhaps they might, to consist together: still,
they could only serve to acquaint us what the
nature of virtue is; they do but slenderly provide
for the practice of it.</p>

<p>Let the philosophers, then, debate this matter
among themselves. It is enough for <i>us</i> to
learn of Solomon, <i>to fear God</i>: To fear <small>HIM</small>,
who is everywhere and essentially present;
who is conscious to all our actions and all our
thoughts; from whose knowledge there is no
escape, from whose justice there is no appeal,
and to whose power there is no hope, or possibility
of resistance.</p>

<p>With this principle, an unquestioned principle
of reason, if there be any, deeply rooted
in the mind, we have indeed an adequate rule
of life; or, what is better, a controuling motive
to put in practice whatever rule of life we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
chuse to follow. Moral systems, taken by
themselves, are poor ineffective things; even
virtue’s self is but a name, till the religious
principle be infused into her. Then it is, that
she lives and acts, and by her powerful influence
inclines the hearts of men <i>to depart from
evil</i>.</p>

<p>Nor let any man apprehend that this religious
fear will degrade, or servilize his virtue. To be
free from sin, and only the servants of God, is
the truest and noblest liberty.</p>

<p>Dismissing, then, all other rules of life, let
us adhere to that, which Solomon prescribes
to us. It had been venerable from any hands,
but comes with an extraordinary grace and
propriety from <small>HIM</small>, who delivers it. So that
none of the parties, concerned in this discourse,
can excuse themselves from paying a peculiar
deference to his judgment.</p>

<p>1. The <small>MEN OF THE WORLD</small> can have no pretence
for declining this determination. The
author of it is no obscure sordid moralist,
whose views of life are confined to a cloyster
or a cottage. He addresses them from the
throne of Israel, when it was the pride of the
East; and from the center of a court, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
had made the envy of the surrounding nations.
The followers of fashion will then act but agreeably
to their own principles, if they respect the
example of such a court, and the authority of
its sovereign.</p>

<p>2. The <small>POLITICIANS</small> will reflect, that their
instructor is himself a great magistrate, consummate
in the arts of government; who yet
could find no secret, but that of <i>the fear of
God</i>, by which he could reign securely himself,
or promote the real welfare and prosperity
of his people. With what complacency do
they sometimes urge a political aphorism, taken
from Aristotle! <i>But a greater than</i> Aristotle
<i>is here</i>.</p>

<p>3. Lastly, to you, the sages of the world,
who are, or account yourselves <small>PHILOSOPHERS</small>,
nothing can be so respectable to you, as the
authority of <small>ONE</small>, whose name is the name itself
of wisdom; of <small>ONE</small>, who, like you, <i>had given
his heart to know wisdom</i><a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>; who had an understanding,
at least, equal to yours, and an
experience of life, far greater. Yet even <small>HE</small>
delivers it, as the result of all his knowledge,
<i>That by the fear of the Lord men depart from
evil</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>It is indeed this principle only, which gives
its proper direction and integrity to every
other. It controuls Fashion; supplies the
defects of Law; and enforces the conclusions
of Reason. It rectifies all our systems, and
gives sense and solidity to all our speculations.</p>

<p>To conclude, Let us all be wise enough to
reverence the plain doctrine of the text, and to
act upon it: The rather, as that doctrine is
not only just and reasonable in itself, but proceeds
from one, whom the Spirit of God had
been pleased to inform with celestial wisdom.</p>

<p><i>All things are lawful unto me; but all things
are not expedient: All things are lawful
for me; but I will not be brought under the
power of any.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> would be taking up too much of your
time, and of this discourse, to explain minutely
the occasion of these words, and the connexion
they have with the general argument of this
chapter. Let it suffice to say, that they are
introduced as an answer to something which
the Corinthian Christians did, or might alledge
for their neglect of the instructions, given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
them by the Apostle. We may conceive them
to speak to this effect—“What you enjoin us
so strictly to avoid, is not one of those practices
which can be deemed unlawful: it is not,
as we conceive, condemned by the law of nature,
certainly, not by the law of that society
to which we belong. Now in matters of this
kind, there is no need of advice or direction:
the things being indifferent in themselves, we
may do as we please, and we are disposed, in
the present case, to make use of our Christian
liberty.”</p>

<p>To this plea, or suggestion, the Apostle replies
in the text: “Admitting, says he, the
truth of what ye alledge for yourselves, it does
not follow that I may not properly and usefully
direct your conduct, in the present case. For
suppose that <i>all things are lawful to me, all
things are not expedient</i>: And, again, <i>though
all things are lawful to me, I will not be
brought under the power of any</i>.”</p>

<p>St. Paul, you see, does not stay to consider
whether the things forbidden to the Corinthians,
were <i>lawful</i> or not (though possibly they might
mistake in that assumption, as licentious or
thoughtless people, we know, every day do)
but, be this as it may, he insists that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
reason to lay them under some restraint even
in <i>lawful</i> things, because the practice of such
things was inexpedient, in many respects;
And because, if all other considerations might
be overlooked, it is enough that an unrestrained
indulgence in them begets slavish habits, and
would, in the end, destroy, or very much impair,
their moral freedom.</p>

<p>Of the words, thus far opened, I propose to
make this use; to dissuade you from giving
a full scope to the pursuit even of innocent
pleasures; and that, from the two considerations,
expressed in the text:</p>

<p>I. That such devotion of ourselves to them
is, on many other accounts, hurtful and improper—<i>all
things are not expedient</i>: And</p>

<p>II. That, in particular, it violates the dignity
of human nature, by taking from us, or
weakening to a great degree, that manly authority
of reason, that virtuous self-command,
which we should always retain, and be in a
condition to exert, even in indifferent matters—<i>I
will not be brought under the power of
any</i>.</p>

<p>1. Wealth and prosperity have a natural
tendency to alter, that is, in the language of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
moralists, to <i>corrupt</i>, the public manners.
Hence it is that the old English habits of
plainness, industry, and frugality, are, now,
exchanged for those of indulgence, dissipation,
and expence. All the elegant accommodations
of life have an unusual stress laid upon them;
and there seems to be a general effort to advance
them all to the last degree of refinement. The
superfluous, which we call the fine arts, excite
an universal admiration, and administer, in ten
thousand ways, to a luxurious, which, again,
takes the name of a polite, indulgence. Hence,
society, which used to fill only the vacant intervals
of business, is now become the <i>business</i>
of life; and yet is found insipid (so insatiable
is the love of dissipation) if it be not, further,
quickened by amusements. These have multiplied
upon us so prodigiously, that they meet
us at every turn, and in every shape; nay, are
grown so common, that they would almost lose
the name of amusements, if every possible art
were not employed to give a poignancy to
them, and if fashion, after all, more than the
pleasure they afford, did not support the credit
of them. As the last resource of the weary
disappointed mind, we have found means to
interest our keenest passions in one species of
amusement, which is therefore called <i>play</i>, by
way of eminence; and is become the favourite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
one, because the most violent: just as the
hottest cordials succeed to the free use of strong
liquors.</p>

<p>In this state of things (a very alarming one,
in all views) nothing threatens the utter ruin of
the little virtue, that is left among us, so much,
as the general persuasion, that such pursuits
may be indulged to any degree, because they
are commonly acknowledged to be <i>lawful</i>.
Here, then, the distinction of the Apostle
comes in very seasonably, and may, one would
hope, be pressed on the lovers of pleasure,
with some effect. We may question, it seems,
the <i>expediency</i> of these pursuits, how indifferent
soever they be in their own nature; and
a little reflexion will shew that they are, indeed,
<i>inexpedient</i>, that is, unprofitable, unadvisable,
improper, in a great variety of respects.</p>

<p>I do not suppose, at present, that the expence
of them is ruinous to those, who devote
themselves to these pleasures (for then they
would plainly not be <i>lawful</i> to such persons);
but consider, if you can afford to pay the price
of them ever so well, they take up too much of
your time: abundantly too much, if you have
any profession to follow, or to prepare yourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
for, as most men have; but too much,
if you have not, because it might, and should
be employed on better things.</p>

<p>Then, of the little time, they leave to yourselves,
they disable you, in some degree, for
making the proper use. For they dissipate
the attention; they relax the nerves of industry
and application; they spread a languor over all
the faculties, and make the exertion of them,
to any valuable purpose, painful at least, if not
impossible. We hear it generally observed,
that there is a scarcity of able men in all the
departments of life. Can it be otherwise, when
the vigour of the mind, which should nourish
all great and laudable efforts, which is so requisite
to push the active powers of invention,
or recollection, to their full extent, is wasted
on trifles, is checked by frivolous habits, and
left to languish under them?</p>

<p>Or say, that you have force of mind enough
to elude this so natural effect of dissipation, is
it nothing that, by giving your countenance to
it, you draw in weaker spirits to make the
dangerous experiment? that you help to propagate
the enfeebling passion through all
quarters, till, from this authorized scene of
vanity, the Capital, the contagion spreads (as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
we see it now does) to the smaller towns, and
even to private houses, in the remotest provinces?
that you contribute to make respectable
I know not what frivolous and worthless arts,
and, of course, to multiply the professors of
them, to the great discouragement and decay of
useful industry? that you hurt the interests of
society, by giving an air of importance to the
veriest trifles, and by diverting on these the attention,
and the passion, that should regularly,
and would otherwise, exert themselves on nobler
objects?</p>

<p>I might push these questions still further.
For I remember what history attests, and what
wise men have said, on the chapter of <i>polite
arts and elegant amusements</i>.</p>

<p>“They tell us, how sad a sign<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> of the times
it is, when they grow into general repute among
us; that from incessantly indulged appetites
(let the object of them be what it will) such an
impotence of mind may follow, such a lust of
gratification, such an impatience of controuling
a predominant fancy, as shall overleap all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
fences of discretion and virtue. The dæmon
of taste, say they, shall be obeyed, in defiance
of every private and public duty, till distress,
disgrace, and infamy break in upon us; till we
seek the relief of our wants in fraud and rapine,
involve the public ruin in our own, and, in the
end, rush blindfold, through an extreme of
profligacy, to desperation.”</p>

<p>To this effect, and in this tone, have some
inveighed against our more refined and elegant
<i>amusements</i>. But I return to what are commonly
known by that name: and with respect
to these, allow me to say that the life of man is
a serious thing<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>: so serious, that dissolute, I
mean, untempered, continued mirth, or pleasure,
is not of a piece with it<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>. Our virtue, our
hopes, nay, our present happiness depends on
keeping the mind in a firm and steady frame.
Whatever encroaches on this manliness of
temper, is pernicious, and unchristian.</p>

<p>I will indulge the extreme candour to suppose,
that, in a constant round of <i>lawful</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
amusements, you do not forget, or intermit
your moral and religious duties. But with
what spirit are they performed? With disgust,
I doubt; but certainly, with indifference.
Nor is this the worst. Temptations are to be
expected in this life: and in what condition are
we to meet them? Nay, we expose ourselves
to needless temptation, even in the midst of
these <i>lawful</i> pleasures; and we bring no power
with us, hardly the inclination, to withstand
it. The present scene distracts the mind, and
fascinates the senses. And, in this delirium of
the whole man, without God in his thought,
or heaven in his eye, what wonder if he become
the sport, and, almost before he is aware, the
victim of every passion!</p>

<p>Still he is not happy in this feverish state: at
most, he but forgets himself, for a moment:
and the intervals of his amusement, which, in
the nature of things, must be many and long,
are filled with disgust and languor. Nay, the
very amusement wears out by frequent repetition.
And then such a sickliness of mind succeeds,
and such a weariness of living on in a
too much used and exhausted world, as is insupportable
and fatal to him<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

<p>You see then there are many good reasons,
which shew the inexpediency of prosecuting
even <i>lawful</i> pleasures with an unrestrained
passion. But, if all others were away, there is
ONE consideration still behind, and of so much
weight, that St. Paul scruples not to make a
distinct argument of it, and to press it on the
Corinthian Christians, as fully decisive of the
point in question—<i>All things are lawful for
me; but</i> <small>I WILL NOT BE BROUGHT UNDER THE
POWER OF ANY</small>—And to unfold this argument
is what I proposed to myself</p>

<p>2. <i>Under the second head of this discourse.</i></p>

<p>It should be the ambition of every man to
preserve the independency of his own mind on
all his natural or acquired inclinations. The
dignity of his character depends on this supremacy:
and his virtue is no longer secure, than
while he retains the power, on all occasions, to
exert it.</p>

<p>1. The stoical wise man was exposed to
much ridicule by taking to himself the name
and office of a king. The pretensions were
high, no doubt, and the language, something
arrogant and ostentatious. But, let the terms,
we employ, be what they will, all philosophy,
that deserves the name, must agree in this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
That to have the command of himself, is the
duty, and chief distinction of a wise man<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.
There is, then, a consistency and harmony in
his whole conduct. We naturally respect those
who give this proof of respecting themselves;
and we place an entire confidence in the vigour
and uniformity of their character.</p>

<p>Again: though the virtue of self-denial shine
out to most advantage in the conquest of ardent
passions and violent temptations, its use is not
inconsiderable in curbing all the lighter fancies.
The reason is, that custom prevails insensibly,
and reaches farther than we, at first, intended.
By humouring the mind in trifles, we teach it to
presume on its own importunity, in greater
matters: and it will be found a convenient
rule in the management of our passions, as of
our children, to refuse a compliance with them,
not merely when they ask improper things, but
when they ask any thing with impatience.</p>

<p>Even our curiosity, an innocent and useful
passion, should be kept within bounds, and
not indulged, as we see it is, on every occasion
that presents itself to us.</p>

<p>The continence of Scipio has been much and
justly applauded. But he went a step too far,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
in seeing his captive. He triumphed, indeed,
over the stronger temptation, but he was not
enough on his guard against the weaker: by
complying too easily with a frivolous curiosity,
he risked the honour of that virtue, which a
pagan historian finds so divine in <small>ONE</small>, who was
<i>et juvenis, et cœlebs, et victor</i><a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.</p>

<p>To apply these reflexions to the case before
us. It may seem to be a matter of great indifference,
whether we indulge an inclination for
<i>lawful</i> amusements, or not. But the dignity
of our character is concerned in keeping a strict
hand over our inclinations of every sort: and,
if it were only for an exercise of self-government,
it would be worth the while to moderate, that
is, frequently to suspend, the use of a favourite,
though innocent gratification. To be enslaved
by vicious habits, is the ignominy of a little
mind: to be superior to all, is the glory of a
great one.</p>

<p>2. But, in truth, there is no security in any
case, if we let go this <i>habit</i> of self-government.
One compliance inevitably brings on another;
and, though we set out with the design of stopping
at a certain point, we shall almost fatally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
be carried much farther. We meant to acquiesce
in this, confessedly harmless, indulgence:
constant use makes it insipid; and then
we venture on one of a suspicious character.
Being now on the confines of vice, we are easily
pushed into that quarter; with some doubt and
hesitation, at first; but scruples give way, as
the habit strengthens, and all vices being connected
with each other, especially all of one
sort, we, by degrees, make the trial of all: and
thus, from an innocent fancy, or inclination,
indulged too freely, at setting out, we slip insensibly,
and beside our purpose, into manifest,
perhaps universal, dissolution.</p>

<p>So salutary, so divine is the resolution of the
Apostle! <i>All things are lawful for me: but
I will not be brought under the power of
any.</i></p>

<p>To interdict amusements, altogether, to the
vivacity of youth, would be severe and cynical.
They are abundantly too numerous, at present,
and too much frequented: but many of them
are supposed to be, and some, without doubt,
are, in themselves, <i>lawful</i>. Of these, only, I
am now speaking: and even of these it must be
affirmed, that the unrestrained use of them is
<i>not expedient</i>; as, for the other reasons suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
to you in this discourse, so chiefly,
because it degrades the man, and enslaves
him.</p>

<p>To conclude; the safe and manly part is, <i>to
be temperate in all things</i><a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>: to make our
pleasures, the occasional relaxation<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> of the
mind, and by no means the employment of it:
not, perhaps, to affect a total abstinence from
them, which the world would account an incivility;
but resolutely to forbear all vicious, or
but suspected pleasures: and, for the rest, to
keep a great deal on this side of what is thought
allowable in the use of them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Matth.</span> v. 38, 39, 40, 41.</h3>

<p><i>Ye have heared that it hath been said, an eye
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I
say unto you, that ye resist not evil</i>: but
<i>whosoever shall smite thee on thy right
cheek, turn to him the other also</i>: And, <i>if
any man will sue thee at the law, and take
away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also</i>:
And <i>whosoever shall compel thee to go a
mile, go with him twain</i>.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I suppose</span>, if these words had been found
in any book whatsoever, except the Bible, no
man of sense could have entertained the least
doubt of their meaning. But, while one sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
of readers think they do honour to God’s word
by taking every precept in the most strict and
rigid sense, and another, by the same mode of
interpretation, hope to dishonour it, we may
expect that, between them, the usual rules of
criticism will be very little regarded.</p>

<p>The text refers us to a law of Moses, which
established the <i>jus talionis</i>, or <i>right of retaliation</i><a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>.
This law, in the main, is consonant
to natural equity; was of general use and authority
in ancient times; has, with some modification,
been adopted by legislators of all
times; and was peculiarly fit, or rather necessary,
in the Mosaic institute, composed in a
very remote age of the world, and addressed to
a fierce and barbarous people.</p>

<p>But this, so reasonable law, had undergone
a double abuse in our Saviour’s time. What
was designed, in the hands of the magistrate,
to prevent future injury, was construed into an
allowance of private and personal revenge:
And, again, what was calculated to prevent
great and outrageous injuries, was pleaded in
excuse for avenging every injury. The Jews
retaliated, at pleasure, on those that offended
them, and for the slightest offence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>Our divine Master, then, without derogating
from the law, when administered in due form,
and on a suitable occasion, applies himself to
correct these so gross perversions of it—I <i>say
unto you, that ye resist not evil</i>—that is, that
ye do not retaliate on the person, that does
you an injury, in the way of private revenge;
or even of a public suit, for small and trivial
injuries.</p>

<p>You see, our Lord’s purpose was, to oppose
the mild spirit of the Gospel to the rigid letter
of the law, or rather to an abusive interpretation
of it: And this purpose is declared in
three familiar and proverbial sayings, which,
together, amount to thus much; “That, when
a small or tolerable injury is sustained by
any one, either in his person, or property, or
liberty, it is far better (and was, thenceforward,
to be the law of Christians) to endure
patiently that injury, or even to risk a repetition
of it, than, by retaliating on the aggressor,
to perpetuate feuds and quarrels in
the world.”</p>

<p>That such is the meaning of the text, would
appear more evidently, if the injuries specified
were, further, considered with an eye to the
sentiments and circumstances of the Jewish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
people. <i>A blow on the cheek</i> was, always, an
indignity, no doubt; but the sense of it was
not inflamed in a Jew by our Gothic notions of
honour; though, if it had, the divine Saviour<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
would scarce have advised his followers to extinguish
it in the blood of a fellow-citizen: the
loss of a <i>vest</i><a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>, or under garment, was easily
repaired, or not much felt, in the cheap and
warm country of Judæa: and the <i>compulsion
to attend another</i><a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>, on his occasions, was not
much resented by a people, that had been
familiarised to this usage by their foreign
masters.</p>

<p>But, without scrutinizing the expression farther
(which, as I said, is of the proverbial cast,
and, therefore, not to be taken strictly) it appears
certainly, that the rule enjoined is no
more than this, “That we are not to act on the
old rigid principle of <i>retaliation</i>, but rather
to exercise a mutual patience and forbearance,
in our intercourse with each other, for
the sake of charity and peace.”</p>

<p>Still, it has been asked, whether this rule be
a reasonable one, and whether the conduct, it
prescribes, be not likely to do more hurt, than
good to mankind?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p>The ground of this question is laid in
following considerations:</p>

<p>First, that resentment, being a natural passion,
was, without doubt, implanted in us for
valuable purposes, and that its proper and immediate
use is seen in repelling injuries:</p>

<p>Secondly, That to eradicate, or to suppress
this movement of nature, is to dispirit mankind,
and to effeminate their character; in
other words, to make them unfit for the discharge
of those offices, which the good of society
requires:</p>

<p>Lastly, That this softness of temper is injurious
to the individuals, in whom it is found,
as it exposes them to many insults, and much
ill usage, which the exertion of a quick and
spirited resentment would enable them to
avoid:</p>

<p>From all which, conclusions are drawn very
unfavourable to the doctrine of the text, and
to the honour of our divine Master. It will,
then, be proper to give the premises a distinct
and careful examination. And,</p>

<p>I. <i>The use of the natural passion of resentment
is not superseded by the law of Jesus.</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
For the legitimate use of this passion is to
quicken us in repelling such injuries as would
render human life wholly burthensome and
uneasy to us, not of those petty affronts and
discourtesies which afflict us much less by
being dissembled and forgiven, than by being
resented and returned. Now Christianity does
not require us to renounce the right of nature
in repelling injuries of the former class. The
law in question, as explained by our Lord
himself, does not, we have seen, import thus
much: and for the rest, the appeal is open to
the principles of nature and common sense—<i>Why
even of yourselves judge ye not what is
right<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>?</i> The practice of the Apostles (the
best comment on the law) shews, too, that, on
certain critical and urgent occasions<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>, they
scrupled not to take advantage of those principles.
So that universally, as it would seem,
where the ends of self-preservation, or of prepollent
public utility, require and justify resistance
in other men, there it is left free for
Christians, likewise, to <i>resist evil</i>; the purpose
of their divine legislator being, in this instance,
to explain the law of nature, and to
guard it from the abuse of our hasty passions,
not to abrogate, or suspend it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>If any case be excepted from the general
permission, it is that of <i>persecution for the
sake of his religion</i>. And possibly this exception
was made in the early days of Christianity,
to afford a striking proof to the world
that this religion owed its success to the divine
protection only, and not to the power of men.
Accordingly, the command given in that case
has an extraordinary, that is, a suitable, promise<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>,
annexed to it. But the end of God’s
special providence having been answered, and
the prophecies accomplished<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>, by the patience
of the saints under the fiery trial of persecution
in those days (whence the miraculous establishment
of our religion is evinced) it seems
allowable to suppose that the Christian world
was, thenceforth, in this, as in other instances,
to conduct itself by the ordinary rules and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
principles of human wisdom; provided that
the object of that wisdom be necessary <i>self-defence</i>,
and not dominion, or revenge, which,
in all the forms of either, Christianity forbids
and reprobates.</p>

<p>But be this as it may, in cases where religion
is not concerned, it seems clear that
Christians are left at liberty to repell intolerable
oppressions by all those means, which
human wisdom dictates. And there is no need
of drawing the line very exactly between <i>tolerable</i>
and <i>intolerable</i> injuries, because the aggressor,
knowing the force of instinctive passion,
has reason, always, to fear, that it will
begin to operate too soon, rather, than too
late.</p>

<p>The apprehension, then, that the proper use
of the natural passion, “<i>resentment of injuries</i>”,
is likely to be defeated by the patient
genius of the Gospel, is weakly entertained:
While, on the other hand, every one must see
the convenience of putting this fiery sentiment
of indignation under some restraint, and of
interdicting the exertion of it in cases, to
which so violent a remedy is ill and hurtfully
applied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>

<p>But</p>

<p>II. It is said, that this doctrine of the Gospel
tends to <i>dispirit and effeminate mankind</i>, and
to <i>render Christians unfit for many offices,
which society requires of them</i>.</p>

<p>What these offices are, one does not readily
conceive, since it is allowed that <i>evil may be
resisted</i>, when it becomes excessive, that is,
when it is worth resisting. But, I suppose, the
objectors mean, this patient spirit of Christianity
damps the vigour with which it is for the
interest of men in society that their civil rights
should be asserted, or a foreign enemy repelled:
they think, in short, it makes <i>bad
citizens</i>, and <i>worse soldiers</i>.</p>

<p>Now to the <small>FORMER</small> charge I reply, that it
only tends to check, or prevent, the turbulent,
the factious, the seditious spirit of any community
(which is surely doing it no hurt) while,
at the same time, it allows men to assert their
essential civil interests by every reasonable exertion
of firmness and courage; nay, inculcates
those principles of a disinterested love for mankind,
and what is properly called a public
spirit, which make it their duty to do so. And
they will not do it with the less effect, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
waiting till the provocation given appear to all
men to be without excuse. <i>The fury of a
patient man</i>, is almost proverbial: and particularly,
in this case, it is to be expected that,
when the natural incitement to resistance, long
repressed and moderated, comes at length to
be authorised by necessity, and quickened by
sense of duty, it will act with a force and
constancy, not a little formidable to those
against whom it is directed. There is no danger,
then, that <i>true patriotism</i> should suffer
by the meek principles of the Gospel of peace.</p>

<p>As to the <small>OTHER</small> charge of their weakening
the <i>military spirit</i>, it must be owned again,
they would render wars less frequent than they
now are, and less destructive—forgive Christianity
this wrong—but, when the necessity of
self-defence (the only justifiable ground of
war) is real and instant, I know not, why the
Christian prince, or Christian soldier, should
want courage, because he had given proof of
this equitable forbearance; or, that either will
be likely to do his duty the worse, for knowing
that what he does, <i>is</i> his duty.</p>

<p>And, if we appeal to fact, it is enough
known, that the Christian soldiery have been
no disgrace to their profession; no, not even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
then, when the unresisting spirit was at its
height, I mean, in the early days of our religion.
Christians had many good reasons for
not being forward to serve in the Roman
armies; but some of them did serve there;
without doubt, when they were released from
such military obligations and observances, as
they esteemed idolatrous: Nay, it appears, that
the number of Christian soldiers was, on some
occasions, considerable: Yet we no where find,
that these patient men misbehaved themselves
in a day of action; or, that they threw away
their swords, when they had said their
prayer.</p>

<p>And I give this instance of bravery in the
primitive Christians, the rather, because it
cannot be imputed to a <i>fanatic spirit</i>, which
is able, we know, to controul any principles:
It cannot, I say, be imputed to a fanatic spirit,
because religion was not the object of those
wars, in which they were engaged: They were
left, then, to the proper influence of their own
principles; which at that time had their full
effect upon them, and yet did not prevent
them from acting with the true spirit of their
profession, that is, with a full sense of the duty
imposed upon them by their engagements to
the state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>

<p>With regard to the <i>publick</i>, then, there is
no reason to think that our Lord’s injunction
will disserve it, in any respect.</p>

<p>III. The last, and most plausible objection
to the conduct prescribed in the text, is,
“That the tame spirit, it discovers, is injurious
to <i>individuals</i>, and only serves to provoke
much insult and ill usage, which a
quick resentment and return of injuries
would prevent.”</p>

<p>This is the common plea, and passes with
many for a full justification, of that false honour,
which predominates in the world, but is
equally frivolous with the other pretences, already
confuted.</p>

<p>For,</p>

<p>1. It is taken up on a groundless and mistaken
notion, that the unfriendly and malevolent
passions are the most natural to mankind.
On the contrary, man is by nature, kind and
generous; proud and vindictive, indeed, if stimulated
by ill treatment, but prompted, again,
by that very pride, to relent at the appearance
of gentleness and submission in the party offending;
and easily disposed to lay aside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
thoughts of revenge, when no obstinate resistance
seems to make it necessary. There are,
certainly, few persons, at least in civilized life,
of so base a temper, as to insult others, and
much less to insult them the more, for their
gentle inoffensive manners. Or, if such monsters
there be, they will soon become detestable
in society; while the objects of their unprovoked
fury find an asylum in the general
good-will and favour of mankind.</p>

<p>They, therefore, who pretend that the world
cannot be kept in order, but by resentment
and revenge, will do well to make trial of the
opposite conduct, before they have recourse to
so boisterous a remedy. They will probably
find, that <i>only by</i> <small>PRIDE</small> <i>cometh contention</i><a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>,
and that they have injured their species, in
thinking otherwise.</p>

<p>2. Let it be remembered, that the Gospel
neither forbids us to take the benefit of the
laws in cases, where the injury is considerable,
nor to resist, without law, in extreme cases;
besides, that our corrupt nature will often get
the better of <i>principle</i>, I mean, when the provocation
is not of that size, as to justify either
remedy. Whence it follows, that brutal force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
and malignity will lie under many restraints,
and will rarely be encouraged by the passive
temper of a conscientious Christian, to proceed
to such lengths, as the objection supposes.
But,</p>

<p>3. Lastly, and principally, we should call to
mind, that, though some ungenerous dispositions
should take advantage of our dissembling
smaller injuries, to repeat, or even increase
them, till they come at length to the utmost
verge of what we call <i>tolerable</i> injuries, yet it
does not follow, from such inconvenience, that
the law is to be accounted inexpedient. For
the law has a general end in view, the good of
society at large, or of the individual: And the
law is a proper one, if the end be commonly
and for the most part attained by the conduct
prescribed, though with some exceptions.</p>

<p>That the lawgiver foresaw the possibility of
such exceptions, is clear from the language,
employed by him. If a blow <i>on one cheek</i> be
patiently received, it may be succeeded by a
blow <i>on the other</i>: if we suffer our <i>coat</i> to be
taken away, our <i>cloke</i> may follow it: and if we
make no resistance to the requisition of going
<i>one mile</i>, we may be compelled to go <i>two</i>.
The inconvenience, then, is supposed and admitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
in the law itself; but it was seen not to
be of moment enough to evacuate the law.
Generally speaking, it will be better to bear
the inconvenience, than to violate the law;
better for the injured party himself, but certainly
better for society, at large.</p>

<p>We are certain, that the law will operate
this effect, because the lawgiver is, by supposition,
divine. He, who knew <i>what was in
man</i>, what his nature, and true interest, is,
could not mistake in adapting the law to the
subject of it. And then, for the <i>exceptions</i>,
he has it in his power to make amends for
those, and to recompense fully, as he engages
to do, any sacrifice we make to conscience,
acting within the scope and purpose of the
law.</p>

<p>So that, on the whole, it is but a just deference
to the law, and to the authority of the
lawgiver, to abstain from <i>resisting evil</i>, according
to the true sense and spirit of the
command, though, by so doing, we subject
ourselves to some, nay to much inconvenience.
For he must be slenderly instructed in the
school of Christ, who is yet to learn, that
greater sacrifices, than these, must be made,
if need be, for the sake of <i>him who died for us</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span></p>

<p>Enough, I hope, has been now said, not
only to vindicate the sacred text, but to let you
see how repugnant the doctrine of it is to that
contentious, vindictive, and even sanguinary
spirit, which prevails so much among those,
who, by a strange abuse of language, call
themselves Christians.</p>

<p>The root of this mischief, is, a pride of
heart, nourished in us by an ill-directed education,
and fostered, through life, by the corrupt
customs and maxims of the world. To
counteract this inveterate evil, we shall do well
to consider who and what we are; weak, infirm,
and sinful creatures, who are provoking
Heaven every day, and should not therefore resent
it much, if we receive but little respect
from men. We should consider, too, that we
are the followers of <small>HIM</small>, who suffered every
indignity without deserving any, and yet requires
no more from us, than he practised
himself, and for our sakes.</p>

<p>Such considerations will make us humble
and meek and placable; ready to forgive, as
we hope to be forgiven; and disposed to make
allowance for those defects in others, which
we have so much reason to lament in ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

<p>Still, if we find the duty, of <i>not resisting
evil</i>, painful and uneasy to us, let us be careful
to avoid the occasions, which require the
exercise of it. A prudent Christian (and
Christianity excludes not, nay enjoins, prudence)
will rarely be put to this trial of his
virtue. We bring an insult on ourselves by
indiscreet liberties, by offensive actions or rash
expressions; and then, rather than retract a
folly, we commit a crime.</p>

<p>After all, the most cautious, inoffensive conduct
may not exempt us, in every instance,
from discourtesies and affronts, from the petulance
or injustice of unreasonable men. In
this case the authority of our divine Master
must controul the movements of nature. We
must resolve to endure what we dare not resist;
and, for the rest, may assure ourselves, that, in
giving this proof of our Christian temper and
principles, we do what is perfectly fit and right
in itself, is singularly conducive to the good of
society, and, whatever our impatient passions
may suggest, will contribute more than any
resistance, to our own true enjoyment, even in
this world.</p>

<p><i>Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my
words, of him shall the Son of man be
ashamed, when he shall come in his own
glory and in his Father’s, and of the holy
Angels.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">If</span> we compare this text with the parallel one
of St. Mark<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>, it will seem probable that it
more immediately concerned the Jews; who,
in consequence of their being <i>ashamed</i> of
Christ, and rejecting him, as their Messiah,
should themselves be covered with shame, and
be rejected by him from being his people,
when he came to take vengeance of their crimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
in the destruction of Jerusalem. In this view,
the words are prophetical of what should, and,
in fact, did, befall the <i>unbelieving Jews</i> of
that age, in which Christ lived; for <i>before
that age was passed, all these things were
fulfilled on</i> that <i>adulterous and sinful generation</i>:
were so remarkably fulfilled, that the
unbelieving Jews, only, were involved in that
calamity, while the Christians, even to a man,
as we are told, providentially made their escape
from it.</p>

<p>But, though this be the primary sense of
the text, we have reason to believe that something
further, and still more terrible, was intended
by it. For the destruction of Jerusalem
was emblematical of that final destruction,
which should await all the enemies of Christ
in the day of judgment; as we may probably
gather from the exaggerated terms in which the
prophecy concerning Christ’s coming to judge
Jerusalem is delivered, and as we certainly conclude
from those passages of scripture, which professedly
describe the final day of judgment, when
<i>all that believe not shall be condemned</i><a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>, and
concerning which our Lord himself says—<i>He
that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
hath one that judgeth him: the</i> <small>WORD</small> <i>which
I have spoken</i>, <small>THE SAME</small> <i>shall judge him in
the last day</i><a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>.</p>

<p>Whence, you see, we are authorized to take
the words of the text in their full force, and to
understand them as a general declaration to
<small>ALL</small>, who shall be <i>ashamed of Christ and of
his words</i>, that <i>of them</i> shall Christ, also, <i>be
ashamed</i>, in the great day of retribution, sublimely
expressed by the circumstance of his
<i>coming in his own glory, and in his Father’s,
and of the holy Angels</i>.</p>

<p>To be <i>ashamed of</i> <small>CHRIST</small>, is very intelligible
language, and means to disown him for
what he claims to be, The Messiah; and to
take it for a degradation to us, a reflexion on
our own sufficiency and importance, to regard
him as our Lord and Saviour. In like manner,
to be <i>ashamed of his</i> <small>WORDS</small>, is, to think it
beneath us to receive his doctrine, and to observe
it: It is to say, or to behave ourselves as
if we said, with neglect and scorn, that we
will not condescend to be influenced and directed
by it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>But how, and in what respects, may we be
said to incur the guilt of this charge? in what
ways, may we testify to the world that the
shame of <small>CHRIST</small> and of his <small>WORDS</small> is predominant
in us?</p>

<p>The inquiry, you see, is of the last importance;
for this <i>shame</i> of Christ, in whomsoever
it prevails, and so far as it prevails, will
be repaid in kind, in that day, when he shall
<i>come in glory</i>, in that day when it so much
concerns us to <i>have boldness</i> before him, <i>in
the day of judgment</i><a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>.</p>

<p>To assist you, then, in making this momentous
inquiry, permit me to lay before you,
gradually and distinctly, the <small>CHIEF</small> of those
cases, which appear to me to express, or imply,
the existence of this <i>false shame</i>; and may
therefore let us see whether we are, or not,
involved in the guilt of it.</p>

<p>I. They (if any such there be) who reject
Christianity on the grounds of a fair impartial
inquiry, cannot so properly be said to be
<i>ashamed</i> of Christ, as to be <i>convinced</i> that he
has no claim to their respect and veneration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
For they deny him, they will say, not from a
principle of <i>shame</i>, or disrespect, but of what
they take to be <i>right reason</i>.</p>

<p>But then, if any oblique views have influenced
their disbelief; if conceit, or vanity, or
presumption, has any share in forming their
conclusions; if a careless or fastidious neglect
of the means, by which they might be better
informed, has mixed itself with their inquiries;
if they have felt the smallest disposition in
themselves to struggle with evidence, or to be
concluded by any thing but evidence; if any,
or all, of these motives can be imputed to them,
they will find themselves liable, more or less, to
the charge of the text; and it surely concerns
them to see that they stand clear of all such
imputations: It concerns them the more, because,
if the revelation be divine, the revealer
knew what evidence was fit to be given of it,
and that the evidence given was sufficient to
the conviction of a reasonable inquirer. To
the severe scrutiny of their own hearts, the
disbelievers on principle are, therefore, referred:
and, <i>if their heart condemn them</i> in
any degree, let them reflect with awe, that
<i>God is greater than their heart, and knoweth
all things</i><a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></p>

<p>But, whatever these immaculate unbelievers
may have to say for themselves, there are others
who have the spots of <i>shame</i> indelibly impressed
upon them.</p>

<p>Such were the Jews of old, who rejected
Christ, not because they wanted evidence of
his mission (for they could not deny, nay they
frankly owned, that <i>he did many miracles</i><a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>),
but because he was the <i>Son of a Carpenter</i><a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>;
because he was of <i>Galilee</i><a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>, and dwelt <i>at Nazareth</i>;
because their <i>rulers did not believe in
him</i><a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>; because they were afraid of being <i>put
out of their synagogue</i><a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>; because <i>they loved
the praise of men more than the praise of
God</i><a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>; in plain words, because on one account
or other, they were <small>ASHAMED OF HIM</small>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span>, too, in succeeding times, were many
of the pagan wise men, who disbelieved, because
the doctrine of the cross was <i>foolishness</i>
to them<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>; because the Jews, who were the
first converts to the faith and the first preachers
of it, were, in their eyes, a contemptible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
people; because the vulgar were generally inclined
to believe in him; because his doctrine
contradicted and degraded their philosophy;
because their pride of reason would not
submit to be tutored by the Galilæan; in a
word, for a hundred frivolous reasons, which
only shewed, that they were <small>ASHAMED OF
HIM</small>.</p>

<p>Such, too, in later times (may we affirm
without a breach of charity) have been, and
are, many of those over-modest men, who
know not how to withstand the raillery of
prophane scoffers; who think the credit of
their parts concerned in rejecting their creed,
and applaud themselves for sitting loose to the
principles, which they call the prejudices, of
their Christian education; who affect to have a
religion of their own making, if they have any
at all, or, rather, disclaim all regard to religion,
on the authority of this or that renowned
patriarch of infidelity; to say all, in a word,
who have the infirmity, and yet make it a
matter of vanity, to be <span class="smcap">ashamed of Jesus</span>.</p>

<p>Now, of such unbelievers it must be said,
that they clearly come within the description
of the text; they are <i>ashamed</i> of the Son of
man, and yet, perhaps, <i>glory in their shame</i>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
to what end, let them reflect, when they read
on, and find, that of such <i>shall the Son of man</i>,
in his turn, <i>be ashamed, when he shall came in
his own glory, and in his Father’s, and of the
holy Angels</i>.</p>

<p>II. [1.] Of men <i>professing</i> Christianity,
they are most exposed to the censure of the
text, who, under a full conviction that Jesus
is the Christ, yet, in <small>WORDS</small>, formally disown
and reject him. Such was the Apostle Peter,
who <i>thrice denied</i> his Lord, though he had not
the least doubt of his divine pretensions. And
why did he deny him? Because, it lessened
him in the eyes of a stranger or two, to have it
believed by them, that he was connected with
a supposed criminal; because he had not the
confidence to bear up against the reproach of a
<i>maid-servant</i>, who <i>looked earnestly upon him,
and said, This man was, also, with him</i>. Such
was the power, which a false shame had upon
this great, and otherwise fervent, disciple of
Christ! A memorable instance of human
frailty, which should admonish believers to be
on their guard against all approaches towards a
crime, the less pardonable, because committed
against the clear sense of the mind, and almost
without temptation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span></p>

<p>St. Peter, it is true, might alledge the passion
of <i>fear</i>, as well as <i>shame</i>: he probably
thought his life in some danger, and had an
eye to his personal safety, as well as credit,
when he denied his Master. Yet when he reflected
on his unworthy conduct, though under
these circumstances of alleviation, he <i>wept
bitterly</i>, as he had reason to do. What then
should they feel, who have not this cloke for
their shame? who deny their Lord without any
inducement to do so, but the weak apprehension
of disgusting some persons, whose sentiments,
after all, they do not really adopt,
themselves. Yet is this no uncommon case.
Men are ashamed to confess with their mouths,
what they believe in their hearts; and give
themselves airs of a frank libertinism, when
they tremble at their own impiety: And all this
to be well with a frivolous circle, which they
frequent, or to merit the good word of certain
fashionable blasphemers.</p>

<p>[2]. Another sort of men seem to come
within the description of the text, who, though
neither prompted by a sense of danger to their
persons, nor of disgrace to their reputation, are
yet induced by a regard to their <i>interest</i>, when
it presses upon them with a certain force, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
dissemble their conviction, or rather openly to
avow their shame of Jesus. Such are they, of
whom our Lord himself speaks, <i>who for a
while believe, and in time of temptation fall
away</i><a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>: And such, in particular, was the
young man in the Gospel, who had no vice to
keep him from believing, nay who would gladly,
perhaps have sacrificed any thing, but his
fortune, to the Christian faith. It seems, as if
he had been upon the point of entering, without
reserve, into the service of his new master,
when, being told, that he must part with <i>all
he had</i>, and then <i>follow him, he grew sad at
that saying, and went away grieved: for he
had great possessions</i><a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>. Poverty was a <i>cross</i>,
which this amiable young man was not prepared
to <i>take up</i>. His faith, which, before, gave a
promise of life and vigour, died away at the
proposal. He now found, doubtless with some
surprize to himself, that he had the seeds of
infidelity lurking in him. He could not resolve
to give this last proof of his sincerity: he,
therefore, withdrew himself from Christ; in
other words, he was <i>ashamed</i> of him. Let us
pity the weakness of this unhappy young man;
and only ask ourselves, if, in his circumstances,
or in any approaching to them, we should not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
have hesitated, as he did, about <i>believing in
the name</i> of the Lord Jesus. If we should, let
us implore the divine grace to strengthen our
faith, and frankly confess, that a secret principle
of <i>shame</i>, though skulking behind some
other and more venial infirmity, has taken hold
of us.</p>

<p>[3]. Still we may not have gone these lengths
of infidelity. We assure ourselves, perhaps,
that no consideration would induce us, simply
and wholly, to renounce the faith, and that, if
the hard alternative was proposed to us, we
should rather give up wealth, fame, and life
itself, than formally deny our Lord, and disclaim
all hopes of interest in him. But let us
explore our hearts a little, those <i>hearts</i>, which,
as we are told and have reason to know, are
<i>deceitful above all things</i><a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>. Have we never in
lesser instances detected ourselves approaching
somewhat towards this ignominious crime of
apostacy?</p>

<p>Have we not contented ourselves with being
the disciples of Christ in private, and with <i>going
to him</i>, as the Ruler of the Jews did, <i>by night</i>,
in secrecy, and, as it were, by stealth, not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
draw the observation of men upon us? Have
we been willing and ready to serve him in the
congregation, to attend his ordinances, and to
revere his sacraments? Have we dared to let
the world see that we are not ashamed of the
cross of Christ<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>? and that we glory in <i>remembering
him</i>, as we are admonished to do, at
his holy table<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>? Have we no reluctance to let
our friends, nay our servants, know<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> that we
live in a daily sense of our duty to him, and
that we hope for all the blessings of this life and
the next, only through his merits and intercession?
Have we never heared his pretensions
slighted, and his holy name blasphemed, without
expressing a becoming zeal for the honour
of our Redeemer? Have we testified out
displeasure at freedoms of this sort by an open
reprehension of them on all fit occasions; at
least by a look and manner, which shewed how
offensive they were to us? On the other hand,
have we never, in such circumstances, by an
assumed air of complacency, seemed to authorize
what we secretly disapproved, and to yield
our assent to propositions which we inwardly
detested? In a word, have we none of us, at
any time, given occasion to unbelievers to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
or think of us, that we were <i>almost</i> inclined to
be of their party; or at least that we had not
the zeal, and firmness and resolution, which
men ought to have, who profess themselves
believers in Jesus?</p>

<p>To these, and other questions of the like sort,
it concerns us to think what answers we could
honestly make. But of this be we assured: If
we have not constantly and uniformly signified,
declared, proclaimed our attachment to
Christ; if we have not taken care to avoid all
irreverence toward our Lord and Master; nay,
if we have not been enough upon our guard to
let no man suspect us of <i>indifference</i> towards
him—we certainly have not done our duty; we
have virtually denied <i>the Son of Man</i>; we have,
in effect, been <i>ashamed</i> of him.</p>

<p>And <small>THUS MUCH</small> may suffice for a commentary
on that part of the text, which more immediately
respects the <small>PERSON</small> of Jesus Christ—<i>Whosoever
shall be ashamed of</i> <small>ME</small>—but
our Lord goes farther, and says—<i>Whosoever
shall be ashamed of me, and of</i> <small>MY WORDS</small>—<i>of
him shall the Son of Man be ashamed</i>, in
the day of judgment.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a new subject of discourse. I
call it a new one; because, though the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
topics run into one, and he that is ashamed of
Christ’s <i>words</i>, may not improperly be said to
be ashamed of <i>Christ himself</i>, yet, for the
sake of method, it may be convenient to keep
these two points distinct, and to give to each a
separate consideration.</p>

<p>It remains, then, to set before you the
principal of those ways, in which we may incur
the guilt, especially, of being ashamed of our
Lord’s <i>words</i>, that is, his <small>DOCTRINES</small>, and
<small>LAWS</small>: a copious and important subject! on
which I shall reserve what I have to say to
another occasion. In the mean time, let us
lay to heart what we have now heard concerning
the honour due to the <small>PERSON</small> of our
great Redeemer. <i>Be we not, therefore,
ashamed of our Lord</i><a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>—but <i>let us</i> resolutely
<i>abide in him, that when he shall appear, we
may have confidence, and not be ashamed
before him at his coming</i><a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> text distinguishes between <i>being ashamed
of</i> <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and being <i>ashamed of his</i> <small>WORDS</small>.
And, though the two charges, in effect, run
into one, yet I have found it convenient, in
point of method, to observe that distinction.
Considering the subject, in this double view,
we shall see more clearly, <i>what</i> the crime is,
which we are here cautioned to avoid, and <i>when</i>
we are guilty of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p>

<p>I have already gone through the first division
of the text, and shall now enter on the second.
If we have not formally disowned, or, in effect,
at least, been <i>ashamed</i> of <small>CHRIST</small>, that is, of
his name, dignity, and person, and of the relation,
which we bear to him, as our <small>SAVIOUR</small>
and <small>REDEEMER</small>, yet have we not felt in ourselves,
and evidenced to others, something of
that disposition in regard to his <small>WORDS</small>, that
is, considering him in the light of our <small>LORD</small>
and <small>MASTER</small>?</p>

<p>Now, to do justice to this part of our subject,
we must consider the <i>words</i> of Christ, first,
in <small>THEMSELVES</small>, or as composing that form and
manner of address, in which he thought fit to
deliver himself to us: and, secondly, in the
<small>SUBJECT MATTER</small> of them, that is, as comprehending
both his <i>doctrines</i> and <i>precepts</i>, <i>articles
of faith</i>, and <i>rules of life</i>, all that, as
our heavenly <i>Instructor</i>, he requires us to believe,
and, as our <i>lawgiver</i>, to put in practice.
In both respects, I doubt, we shall, many of
us, find that we have too much, and too often,
been ashamed of Christ’s <i>words</i>.</p>

<p>I. Under the first consideration of the words
themselves, that is, of his <i>manner</i> in addressing
himself to us, let it be observed, that, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
it be true, in several respects, that <i>never man
spake as this man</i>, yet this commendation
must not be extended to the <i>language</i> of his
discourses, in which no peculiar art or elegance
is affected. He condescended to speak, as any
other Jew might have done, and as his Apostle
afterwards did, plainly and clearly enough to
convey his meaning, but not with <i>the enticing
words of man’s wisdom</i>, that is, of men cultivated
and polished in the school of Greek or
Roman learning. Hence, both in ancient and
modern times, such as were, or pretended to
be, so accomplished, have not unfrequently
objected to the style of the Gospel, as rude and
barbarous, and not composed with that beauty,
which they have been taught to admire in
the masters of fine writing. Now, though this
pedantry might, perhaps, be excused in an
old Pagan sophist, and is naturally enough
assumed by a modern classical unbeliever, one
is shocked to find it in professed Christians.
And yet, I doubt, there are not a few of those,
who are <i>half ashamed</i> of the Gospel, because
not written in the best Greek, or according to
the rules of the most approved rhetorick: I
doubt, there are even those who might tell us,
if they would (as a polite Italian philologist
has done) that they read their bible but seldom,
lest a familiarity with it should hurt their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
style; or perhaps abstain from reading it, altogether,
because not fashioned according to their
ideas of elegant composition.</p>

<p>It would be paying too much respect to this
frivolous delicacy, to enter into a formal confutation
of it. What I shall say to it is, briefly,
this; first, that the style of scripture, though
not classical, is by no means destitute of life
and beauty: secondly, that, although it were,
where the matter of it concerns us so much, it
is childish to lay any great stress on the manner:
that, <i>further</i>, the very objection turns
to the honour of the Gospel, which was purposely
so composed that the effect of it, in the
conversion of the world, might be seen to flow
from supernatural causes, and <i>that our faith
should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in
the power of God</i>.</p>

<p>To all which I might add, what perhaps is
a secret to our polite objectors, that the rules
of writing and speaking are more arbitrary than
they are taken to be: that they refer to our
customs and manners, and derive their merit
from that reference, only; that, in different
times and places and under different circumstances,
the same manner may be good and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
bad; and that there is no universal archetype
of perfect speech, existing in nature<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.</p>

<p>But these minute inquiries are not for this
time and place. On whatever principles the
style of scripture may be vindicated, or if it
cannot be vindicated at all to a fastidious reader,
still I affirm, that the taking offence at it is a
species of that false shame, which the text
condemns, and which deserves condemnation.
When the <i>word of God</i> is held up to us in the
great day, and the inquiry is, what attention
we have paid to it, think how poor a subterfuge
it will be from the <i>shame</i>, that will then
overtake us, to reply, in the face of men and
angels, that it was not the <i>word</i> of Cicero or
Plato.</p>

<p>Having dismissed this trifling cavil, let us
now see,</p>

<p>II. In the next place, in what respects it
may be charged upon us that we have been
ashamed of Christ’s <i>words</i>; that is, of their
<small>SUBJECT MATTER</small>; considered in the double
view of the <i>doctrines</i>, and <i>precepts</i>, contained
in them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span></p>

<p>1. As to the <small>DOCTRINES</small> of Christ, that
is, the peculiar articles of Christian faith, one
would think that to reject, or question, or explain
away these, was inconsistent with the
very profession of Christianity. Yet this conduct
in some shape or other, presents itself to
us every day, in those who are, or who desire
to be thought, Christians; and one cannot but
wonder at the pains they take to draw upon
themselves this charge of inconsistency.</p>

<p>Some, bolder than the rest, would expunge
whole chapters, nay books, from the sacred
canon, when the narrative rises above their
faith, or the doctrine will not sink to a level
with their wisdom; others content themselves
with nibbling at single sentences, or, perhaps,
words; and, if no obscure manuscript be at
hand to favour the system they adopt, take
refuge in a forced, unnatural punctuation. How
many ancient and modern heresies have we seen
supported by that presumptuous, or this minute
strain of criticism!</p>

<p>Some, again, when the text is not called in
question, turn their ingenuity another way, and
strike out new modes of interpretation. They
mangle and disfigure plain facts, or resolve them
into allegories: of this class were those primitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
heresiarchs, who maintained that <i>Christ
was not come in the flesh</i><a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>, and that <i>the Resurrection
was past already</i><a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>; and of the same
family, too, are those presumptuous moderns,
of whatever name, who stumble at the cross of
Christ, and sink the doctrine of Redemption in
a metaphor.</p>

<p>A third sort excell in puzzling a clear text,
in putting a violent construction on artless
words, in explaining mysteries by metaphysics,
or, to get rid of them at once, in making
the plain fishermen of Galilee speak the language
of Platonism, or of the Jewish cabbala.</p>

<p>In a word, it would be endless to specify all
those, who by studied devices, of various kinds,
mutilate, prevert, misinterpret, confound the
word of God, obtruding their own sense upon
it, and finding any thing there rather than the
plain obvious mind of the Revealer.</p>

<p>And why is all this industry employed, these
daring liberties taken? Why to make <i>Christianity
not mysterious</i>, to shew how reasonable
its doctrines are, and to remove all objections
against them. The pretence is fair. But shall
we then admit nothing in scripture, in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
scripture which we call divine, but what we
perfectly understand, and can make appear, in
all its parts, to harmonize with our systems?
Alas, what is this, but to prescribe to the
Spirit of God; to substitute our wisdom in the
place of his; in a word, to be ashamed of
Christ’s words, and to idolize our own reason.</p>

<p>To give one remarkable instance, out of
many, of this false shame. If there be any
thing clearly revealed in holy scripture, it is,
that there is a world of spirits, good and bad:
and of the last, that there is <small>ONE</small>, placed at the
head of them, who sets himself in opposition
(as indeed all bad men do) to the will of God;
who had a share in seducing our first parents,
and still works in the children of disobedience;
who was even permitted to tempt Christ, and to
possess Judas; in a word, who is styled the
<i>Prince of this world</i>, and, for the overthrow
of whose empire, principally, the Son of God
came down from heaven: If I say, there be any
clear undisputed point of doctrine in the Gospel,
it is this: the whole scheme of Christianity
depends upon it: and yet what pains have not
been taken to exterminate evil spirits, and disenchant
the world of them; although by such
methods, as would render language itself of no
use, and confound all the rules of just criticism
and sober interpretation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span></p>

<p>These interpreters, I know, pretend (and
many of them, I dare say, with good faith) a
zeal for the honour of God, in their attempts of
this nature. But let them look deep into themselves.
They will, perhaps, find, that they are
paying, at the same time, a secret homage to
their own understandings, as if the whole of
God’s moral government lay open to their view,
and they were able to pervade every part of it;
that they hold a revelation in no esteem, which
puzzles their philosophy; and that, therefore,
they force a meaning of their own on the words
of Christ, because they are inwardly <i>ashamed</i> of
that, in which his words are most naturally to
be taken.</p>

<p>Leaving, then, these rationalists to the scrutiny
of their own inmost thoughts, let us inquire,</p>

<p>2. What regard is due to the <i>words</i> of Christ,
considered not as articles of belief, but <i>rules of
practice</i>.</p>

<p>And here, I doubt, it must be acknowledged
that we have, all of us, more or less, been
<i>ashamed</i> of our divine Master. For we are convicted
of this shame, whenever we disobey his
commands, seen and admitted to be <i>his</i>, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
account of any repugnancy they have to the
fashion of the world, and to the consideration
we affect to have in it. And who is there, that,
in this respect, can hope to stand clear of all
blame, <i>when he is judged</i>?</p>

<p><i>Be meek and lowly of heart</i>, says our Lord.
On the contrary, we are proud and arrogant,
that we may not be thought to want spirit.
<i>Take no thought for to-morrow</i>, are the words
of Christ: but the world says, be rich and great;
and we think of nothing else but <i>to-morrow</i>.
<i>Blessed are the pure in heart</i>, says our spotless
Preceptor: Are we not <i>ashamed</i> of these words,
when we had rather run the risk of any defilement,
than appear unfashionable? And so
in a multitude of other instances.</p>

<p>Still, perhaps, we respect the rule, in some
sort, and blame ourselves for the breach of it.</p>

<p>But what shall we say of those, who reject
the <i>word spoken</i> with a high hand, and offend
against it on principle, as we may say, and by
system?</p>

<p><i>Go and sin no more</i>, says our Lord to an
adulteress convict; and his words imply a severe
censure of having sinned at all, in that instance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
But are there none who think this a hard saying,
who regard it as a narrow prejudice; who treat
the observance of it as a needless scruple; nay,
who pique themselves on the violation of it?
Are there not some, who delight in this sin by
way of preference? who lay it down for a maxim,
that this commerce, under certain circumstances,
and covered with a certain veil of manners,
is allowable, is reputable, is meritorious? Nay,
are there not those who would take it ill to be
thought incapable of aspiring to that distinction,
which, in certain quarters, this commerce
supposes?</p>

<p>But let me not enlarge farther on this horrid
subject. Consider only, whether the parties
concerned must not deride a precept, which
they are proud to transgress, and whether in the
saddest sense of the word, they may not be said
to be <i>ashamed</i> of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> instance occurs, the mention of
which, I am sensible, can be of no farther use
than to illustrate my subject. A placability of
temper, the forgiveness of injuries, the love of
our enemies, nothing is more insisted upon in
the Gospel, than these virtues, which make
the very essence of a Christian’s temper. The
precepts to this purpose are numberless and express,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
and enforced with all possible authority.
Yet, to persons, in certain conjunctures, and
of a certain rank in the world, it would be an
affront, but to remind them of their duty. We
know, who it was, that, <i>when he was reviled,
reviled not again, when he suffered, threatened
not, but committed himself to him who judgeth
righteously</i><a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>. But what then? Neither precept,
nor example, moves him, who calls himself
a man of honour, and is the slave of fashion.
He has command enough of himself to assume
an air of tranquillity, and to observe all the
forms of good-breeding. But his hate is rancorous,
his resentment hot as hell, his revenge,
immortal. Let his pretences be what
they will, his conduct cries aloud to all the
world, “I renounce the Gospel, I am <i>ashamed</i>
of the meek and merciful religion of Jesus.”</p>

<p>To conclude: We now understand in what
ways, and in how many respects, we may be
<i>ashamed of Christ and his words</i>. In recounting
those several ways, whether respecting the
name and dignity of our Lord, or the rule of
faith and practice, which he has given us, we
have seen, at the same time, how little, how
base, how ungrateful, how impious, how inexcusable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
in all views, this <i>shame</i> is: especially
in all those, who wear the name, and do not
wholly disclaim the faith, of a Christian. More
words would be thrown away on those, who
are insensible to such considerations. Or, if
any further remonstrance can be of use, if
there be a motive left that can reach their case,
it must be one, that alarms their fears, and
shews the danger, the unspeakable hazard, to
which they expose themselves by this miserable
conduct. And, in the whole extent of God’s
word, there is not, in the nature of things there
cannot be, a more awakening, a more terrible
denunciation, than that of the text, which
therefore I cannot do better than leave with
you in its own proper form, as pronounced by
our Lord himself—<i>Whoever shall be ashamed
of me and of my words, of him shall the Son
of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his
own glory, and in his Father’s, and of the holy
Angels</i>.</p>

<p><i>I say also unto thee, that thou art</i> <small>PETER</small>, <i>and
upon this rock I will build my church; and
the gates of hell shall not prevail against it</i>.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> way of giving a new name to an eminent
person, more immediately concerned in
any great transaction; a name, expressive of
that transaction, and therefore proper to fix
and perpetuate the memory of it; this custom,
I say, was of known use in the ancient world.
Thus, when God renewed his covenant with
<i>Abram</i>, and engaged to <i>multiply him exceedingly</i>,
the name of this patriarch was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
changed to <i>Abraham</i>; which name, in the
Hebrew language, signifies <i>the father of a
great multitude</i><a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>: and, for a like reason, the
patriarch <i>Jacob</i> took the name of <i>Israel</i><a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>; to
omit many other instances of this usage, which
occur in the sacred scriptures.</p>

<p>Just so, when one of the Apostles, known
before by the name of <i>Simon</i>, had made a
memorable confession of his Master’s being
<i>the Christ, the son of the living God</i>, i. e. the
redeemer, the prince of Israel, the Messiah
foretold, our blessed Lord, to give weight and
emphasis to this confession, confers a new
name upon him. For he <i>answered and said
unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona;
for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
thee, but my Father which is in heaven</i>: That
is, no man hath revealed this great truth to
thee, nor has any interest of man, any thing,
indeed, but the spirit of God, influencing thy
impartial and well-disposed mind, prompted
thee to entertain and avow it thus heartily and
publicly (the proofs of it not being, at present,
so strong, as they hereafter shall be): Therefore,
to express my approbation of this great
testimony to a truth, which is the fundamental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
article of my religion, and, at the same time,
to signify to thee the honour, with which I
mean to reward thee for it, <i>I further say unto
thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock
will I build my Church; and the gates of hell
shall not prevail against it</i>.</p>

<p>The name, <i>Peter</i>, signifying a <i>rock</i> in the
Greek language, implies, we see, the immoveable
truth of the confession, here made, on
which the Christian religion was to be built;
and the immoveable firmness, too, of the Confessor,
who should have a share, with the other
Apostles, in supporting the whole fabric, and
be himself, in point of time, the first stone,
on which the glorious superstructure was to be
made.</p>

<p>It follows—<i>and the gates of hell shall not
prevail against it</i>—that is, <i>Death</i>, or <i>Destruction</i>
(for that, only, the oriental phrase—<i>the
gates of hell</i>—here signifies<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>) shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
never prevail against this church, being founded
on thee, and the testimony, made by thee, as
on a rock of ages, which shall never give way,
or be removed.</p>

<p>We see, then, the full meaning of this famous
text, which contains, in effect, <small>TWO</small>
prophecies: <small>ONE</small>, respecting the foundation of
the Christian church, and (so far as the Apostle
Peter was personally concerned in the prediction)
then verified, when Peter laid the first
stone of this august building in the converts
made by him both among the Jews<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> and Gentiles<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>:
the <small>OTHER</small> prophecy, respecting the
perpetuity of this church; which the divine
Providence would, in no future age of the
world, permit to be destroyed.</p>

<p>So that, not the supremacy of Peter over the
rest of the Apostles (as the church of Rome
vainly pretends), but the priority of his claim,
in point of time, to signal services in the conversion
of mankind, is expressed in this memorable
promise made to Peter—<i>on this rock
will I build my church</i>: and, for the second
assurance, here given, and which, to so zealous
a master-builder, as our Apostle, must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
been singularly welcome—<i>that the gates of
hell shall never prevail against it</i>—we may,
now, by the experience of more than seventeen
hundred years, understand, how far it has been,
and how likely it is, in the full extent of the
words, to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>But, to see little more distinctly what this
experience is, and what presumption arises
out of it for the truth of our holy religion, let
us call to mind, if you please, the more remarkable
of those attacks, which have been
made, at different times, on the church of
Christ, and yet how constantly and successfully
they have been repelled.</p>

<p>I. No sooner had the foundations of the
church been laid on the <i>rock</i> of this testimony—that
<i>Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God</i>—than
the storms of persecution arose, and
beat violently upon it. Nor was it, indeed,
strange, that this new doctrine, published every
where, with great boldness, by men who had
been eye-witnesses of what they affirmed, and
calculated to overturn all the favourite maxims
and usages of the world, should meet with the
fiercest opposition. And how easy did it seem
for that world to crush the infant society, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
struggling for life in the hands of twelve poor,
illiterate, and friendless men, if the decree of
Heaven had not gone forth—<i>that the gates of
hell should not prevail against it</i>!</p>

<p>I know, indeed, that this violence of persecution
was, in the end, of advantage to the
Christian cause; and, from the nature of the
human mind, when once persuaded of any
thing, true or false, might be expected to be
so. For cruelty, in such cases, only excites
an unconquerable firmness and perseverance.
But what was persuasion in succeeding converts
to the gospel of Christ, was knowledge,
or rather the infallible evidence of sense, in
the first publishers of it. The Apostles witnessed
a matter of fact, when they made known
the resurrection of Christ, on which their
whole doctrine rested. And it is not in nature
for any single man, much less for twelve men,
to suffer, and to die, for a false fact, not taken
upon trust from others, but asserted on their
own proper and personal experience. If Jesus
did not rise from the dead, they neither saw,
nor felt, nor conversed with him after his resurrection,
that is, they had no persuasion for
force to harden into obstinacy, but a consciousness
of falshood in their attestation, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
could not have held out against the rage of
their persecutors<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>.</p>

<p>If it be said, that criminals are often supposed,
and not without reason, to die with a
falshood in their mouths, I answer, it is very
possible: but, besides that the Apostles gave
no signs, in the rest of their conduct, of a want
of principle, by declaring the truth, in this
case, they might have saved their lives, whereas
a criminal, for the most part, is but the more
likely to lose his, by a true confession.</p>

<p>Or, if, lastly (for suspicion, I am aware, is
not easily satisfied, if) the perseverance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
martyred apostles be accounted for from a false
point of honour, I admit, that this strange
principle sometimes overpowers conviction;
but rarely, in any number of men confederated
in the same cause, and, least of all, in a number
of men of so plain and artless characters, as the
Apostles.</p>

<p>On the whole, we have reason to conclude,
that, if Christianity had not been true, it must
have perished with its first preachers: at least,
it cannot be denied, that in outliving the violence,
with which it was assaulted, both by
Jew and Gentile, on its appearance in the
world, this religion has thus far verified the
remarkable prediction of its author.</p>

<p>II. The external peace of the church was
scarce settled under Constantine, when internal
commotions shook its frame, and with a
violence, which was likely to bring on, and
that in no long time, its entire dissolution. By
these commotions, I mean the heresies, that
sprung up in abundance, and distracted the
Christian world for several centuries. The zeal,
or rather fury, with which these disputes were
carried on, was unappeasable; and, if it be true,
that <i>a house divided against itself cannot
stand</i>, there was reason to expect that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
houshold of Christ would exemplify this
maxim: While, at the same time, the Christian
name was so dishonoured by these contentions,
and the lives, as well as the faith, of
Christians, so polluted by them, that believers
themselves were almost tempted to renounce a
profession, which laboured under so much infamy;
and the rest of the world could scarce
fail to contract an incurable aversion to it.</p>

<p>This, indeed, was so much the case, and the
advantage, given to the enemies of our faith, by
these scandalous abuses of it, so great, that one
is not surprised to find</p>

<p>III. A <i>third</i>, and still more alarming danger
of the Christian church, in the sudden rise
and propagation of the Mahometan religion.</p>

<p>For it was the corruption of Christianity,
that gave occasion, or success, at least, to this
daring imposture. And now it might seem,
that <i>the gates of hell</i> were set wide open, and
destruction ready to rush upon, and seize, its
defenceless prey, the Christian church, disheartened
and disabled by its own vices. The
uncontroulable spirit of this ruthless sect was,
indeed, alarming to the last degree; when a
secret providence, first, softened its ferocity,
and, then, put a stop to its successes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span></p>

<p>I ascribe these effects to the <i>good providence
of God</i>, watching over the preservation of our
holy faith; for what else could make the disciples
of Mahomet tolerant in spite of their
ignorance and bigotry; and pacific, when their
law breathed nothing but war and universal
dominion?</p>

<p>Still the church had other trials to undergo;
and <i>hell</i> had yet in reserve some further engines
of its wrath to employ against her. For</p>

<p>IV. While the African and Asiatic Christians
were in danger of a total suppression by
the rage of their Ottoman masters, the European
had almost as much to apprehend from exhaustless
swarms of Northern barbarians. And,
what darkened the prospect still more, all
knowledge and learning had disappeared,
during these turbulent ages. Hence, to the
destructive fanaticism of the East, was added
the grossest <i>superstition</i> of the West; which,
growing up in a long night of ignorance, and
yet directed by policy towards the establishment
of a vast and gloomy empire, involved all Christendom
in its pestilential shade, and threatened
the very extinction of all true religion.</p>

<p>Yet it pleased God, in this distressful state
of his church, to provide for its continuance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
and even integrity, in due time, by making the
cloystered ignorance of the Monks serve to the
preservation of the sacred canon; and the enslaving
projects of a tyrannical hierarchy, to
the restoration of religious and civil liberty.</p>

<p>And thus, though the powers of <i>hell</i> had
been successively let loose against the church of
Christ in the terrible shapes, first, of Jewish
and Gentile persecution; then, of heresy, in
the church itself; next, of Mahometan enthusiasm;
and, lastly, of Antichristian superstition;
yet have they not prevailed against this
sacred structure, founded on a <i>rock</i>, guarded,
as we believe, by heaven itself, and therefore
destined to be eternal.</p>

<p>I have touched these several particulars
slightly and rapidly, just to put you in mind of
what the Christian religion has endured, since
its appearance in the world; and to let you see
how unlikely it is that this religion should have
kept its ground against these various and multiplied
attacks, if it had not been divinely
protected.</p>

<p>But of all the trials, to which it has been exposed,
the greatest by far, if this religion had
been an imposture, is <small>ONE</small>, which I have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
yet mentioned; and that is, <i>the examination
of severe, enlightened Reason</i>.</p>

<p>And this trial, to complete its honour, our
divine faith hath <small>TWICE</small> undergone: <i>once</i>, in
the very season of its birth; and now, <i>again</i>,
for two or three centuries, since the revival of
letters, in our Western world: periods, both of
them, distinguished, in the annals of mankind,
by a more than common degree of light and
knowledge; which must, in the nature of
things, have been fatal to any scheme of religion,
pretending only to a divine original, and
not really so descended.</p>

<p>But this part of the argument is too large, as
well as too important, for me to enter upon at
present. Let me therefore conclude with a short
and interesting reflexion on so much of it, as
we have been considering.</p>

<p>It was natural, no doubt, for the author of a
new religion, full of his scheme, and impressed
with the importance of it, to promise to himself
the perpetuity of his work. But a wise man
might easily conjecture that a religion, like the
Christian, would meet with the fiercest opposition:
and, though this be not a proper time
to shew it, it might be shewn, that <i>the spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
of Christ</i><a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> distinctly foresaw the several species
of opposition, which his religion had to encounter<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, in the face of all these perils, our Lord
predicts, in the most direct and positive terms,
that his church should brave them all, and
subsist for ever. It has subsisted to this day,
after encountering such storms of persecution
and distress, as must, in all likelihood, have
overturned any human fabrick. Is not the
true solution of the fact, this, that it was
founded on <i>the word of God, which endureth
for ever</i><a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>? The rest, then, follows of course.
The wise master-builder (to use his own words
on another occasion, near akin to this) <i>had
built his house upon a</i> <small>ROCK</small>: <i>and the rain descended,
and the floods came, and the winds
blew and beat upon that house: and it</i> <small>FELL
NOT</small>, <i>for it was founded upon a</i> <small>ROCK</small><a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> religion of Jesus hath descended to us,
through <small>TWO</small>, the most enlightened ages of the
world. It was, first, published in the reign of
Tiberius: It was re-published, as we may say,
at the Reformation: and is it likely, that an
imposture should have made its way in the
<i>former</i> of these periods? Or, is it possible, it
should still keep its ground against the influence
of all that light and knowledge, by which
the <i>latter</i> has been distinguished?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

<p>To see what force there is in these questions,
permit me to lay before you a slight sketch of
the trials, to which Christianity has been exposed
from the improved reason of ancient and
modern times, and of the effect, which those
trials appear to have had on the credit and reception
of that Religion.</p>

<p>I. Jesus preached the Gospel in the reign of
Tiberius: that is, in a time of profound peace,
when arts and letters were generally diffused
through the Roman empire; and in Judea, at
that time a Roman province. So far was this
thing from being <i>done in a corner</i><a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>!</p>

<p>This religion, on its first appearance in the
world, had therefore to encounter two sorts of
men, well qualified, and not less disposed, to
give it a severe examination; I mean, the
learned <small>JEWS</small>, on the one hand, and the reasoning
<small>GENTILES</small>, on the other. Yet it prevailed
against all the efforts of both.</p>

<p>It was, first, proposed to the <small>JEWS</small>, and its
pretensions were to be tried by the correspondence
of its principles and history to the doctrine
and predictions of their sacred books.
That vastly the greater part of the Jewish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
nation resisted the evidence of that appeal, is
well known: but that great numbers did not,
and, of these, that some, at least, were of principal
note for their rank, and knowledge in the
scriptures, is equally certain and allowed; with
this further concession, that the evidence,
whatever it was, prevailed over the most inveterate
prejudices, that ever possessed any people,
and the most alarming difficulties and discouragements,
to which human nature can be
exposed. Let the fact, then, be considered,
with all its circumstances, on both sides. And
as to the merit of the argument, we are well
able to judge of it. The sacred writings of
the Jews, to which the appeal lay, are in all
hands: and with what triumphant superiority
the followers of Jesus reasoned from them, we
see, in their numerous works, still extant, and
especially in those of the great Apostle, St.
Paul. So that, if all the scriptural learning,
and all the bigotry of Judaism, could not stop
the progress of Christianity, as we know it did
not, it may fairly be presumed, that the way
of inquiry was not unfavourable to the new
religion, and that truth and reason were on
that side. But</p>

<p>2. From the Jews, let us turn to the <small>GENTILES</small>,
at that time flourishing in arts and letters.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
To them was the Gospel preached by
the Apostles, and especially by their Apostle,
St. Paul, through the whole extent of the Roman
empire; and not without success in the
head quarters of Gentilism, in the chief towns
of Asia, in Greece, at Athens, and even at
Rome itself.</p>

<p>The pride of Gentile wisdom, indeed, kept
its professors, for some time, from taking more
than a superficial notice of the new religion.
But its rapid progress among the people, joined
to its declared purpose of prescribing to the
general faith of mankind, broke through this
real or affected indifference, rouzed, at length,
the attention of the great and wise, and provoked
the zeal of both to shew itself in every
mode of opposition. The great persecuted, and
the wise reasoned: and this latter species of
hostility (the more alarming of the two, if
Christianity had been an imposture) was carried
on with vigour, and without intermission
(whatever intervals there might be of the
<i>former</i>) through several successive ages. The
four Gospels, and the other authentic documents
of our religion, were now in all hands,
when this lettered war commenced against
Christianity, and continued, till Paganism was
utterly overthrown and subdued. Many adversaries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
of the Christian name engaged in this
unequal contest: but the most distinguished
are, <small>CELSUS</small>, in the second century; <small>PORPHYRY</small>,
in the third; and <small>JULIAN</small>, in the fourth: all of
them, eminent philosophers; and the last of
this great triumvirate, an imperial one. The
two first wrote with all freedom, because
against a persecuted, and on the side of the
predominant, religion; and the third had the
whole power of the state in his own hands.</p>

<p>The works of these great chieftains of infidelity,
it must be owned, are not extant in
their proper form. But Celsus is almost entire
in Origen; a great part of Julian may be seen
in Cyril; and considerable fragments of Porphyry’s
work have been preserved in Jerom
and other old writers.</p>

<p>Ye do not expect me to produce, on this
occasion, the substance of what these three
philosophers have said against the Christian
cause. Any that will, may see it in the original
authors, just mentioned, or in many modern
collections, that have been made out of
them. It may be enough to say, that those,
who give themselves this trouble, will find
much abuse and misrepresentation, and some
argument: but the last so weak, and inconclusive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
that one cannot wonder much at what
Chrysostom tells us, “That the early books,
written against Christianity, soon fell into a
general contempt; that they perished almost
as fast as they appeared; and that, if they
still subsisted any where, it was, because
they had been preserved by the Christians
themselves<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>.”</p>

<p>But, setting aside, for the present, the merits
of the question, the fact<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>, we know, is,
that all the efforts of Greek and Roman philosophy
were not successful: that the church
was soon filled with its professors, even before
the empire became Christian: and that this
great event itself happened within little more
than three centuries from the birth of Christ.
<i>So mightily grew the word of God, and
prevailed</i>, notwithstanding the severity, with
which its pretensions were tried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span></p>

<p>It will be said, however, “that the argument,
drawn from the success of Christianity,
is not altogether so convincing, as we
pretend: that, for a time, the learned heathens
paid but little attention to the new
sect; that, when it had taken such root
among the people as to become the general
subject of inquiry, learning was now very
much on the decline; that barbarism had
prevailed to a great degree before the days of
Constantine, and then increased so fast, especially
after the irruption of the Northern
nations, as to leave no traces, almost, of
light and knowledge; and that to this sottish
state of ignorance, and, its usual attendant,
credulity, which continued through many
ages, the widely extended and permanent
establishments of Christianity are, therefore,
most probably to be ascribed.”</p>

<p>Now, though I cannot assent to what is here
alledged, or insinuated, that the adversaries of
Christianity wanted either time, or light, or
zeal enough to discredit its pretensions, if the
way of reason and disputation could have done
it, before that long night of ignorance came
on which is supposed to be so favourable to
religious imposture; yet I will not deny that
taste and literature were degenerating in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
Roman empire, from the time that learned
pagans began to interest themselves in the
controversy with the Christians; and that,
therefore, had the last only prevailed through
this period of declining letters, something
would have been wanting to the force and
integrity of that argument, which infers the
truth of their cause, from its success. But the
fact is, that the event has been the same, in
opposite circumstances; as I shall now shew,</p>

<p>II. Under the <small>SECOND</small> head of this discourse;
in which I proposed to point out to
you, very briefly, the influence of <small>REVIVING,
AND REVIVED</small> letters on the credit and reception
of the Christian faith.</p>

<p>From the middle of the 14th century, and
even earlier, there were some efforts made to
break through that gloom of ignorance and
superstition, which had so long overspread the
Christian world; and, before the end of it, it
was visible enough that these efforts would, in
no long time, be attended with success. Accordingly,
a zeal for true and ancient literature
made its way through most parts of Europe,
and with so rapid a progress, that multitudes
of able men arose within the compass of the
next century, and were enough instructed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
assist in the reformation of religion, which
followed in the commencement of the 16th.
From that time to the present, arts and letters
have been studied with unceasing application;
and all the powers of reason put forth in the
cultivation of knowledge, in the discovery of
error, and the search of truth. It is pretended,
that we are now enlightened beyond the example
of all former ages: it is credible, that,
in some places, where liberty has attended
the pursuits of learning, the utmost ability
of the human mind, on the most important
objects of science, has been exerted and
displayed.</p>

<p>Now, amidst this blaze of light, gradually
ascending from the dawn of science to its meridian
lustre, what has been the fortune of the
divine religion, we profess? It has been the
first, and last object of attention. It has been
examined with the most suspicious and sceptical
curiosity. It has stood the attacks of wit,
of learning, of philosophy; and, sometimes, of
all these acting in concert, without any restraint
or reserve whatsoever. Yet it keeps its
ground; or rather the belief of it is entertained,
not only by the multitude, but, more firmly
than ever, by the ablest and wisest men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span></p>

<p>For the truth of this assertion, I can only
refer you to your own fair and candid observation;
the proof of it being much too long to
be given, at this time. For it would require
me to set before you the several topics of
argument, which have been employed against
Christianity, and the futility of them. It
would, further, oblige me to make appear, that
the number of those, who still embrace Christianity,
is not only vastly greater, but their
names, too, beyond comparison, more respectable,
than of those who reject it: all which it
would be tedious, indeed, but not difficult to
shew.</p>

<p>However, till some such proof be produced,
ye will be apt, I know, to remind me of many
eminent persons, who have been the declared
enemies of our religion: ye will object to me
the complaints, which even divines make, of
an overflowing infidelity in the present times.</p>

<p>In abatement of this prejudice, I could say
with much truth, that the character of those
eminent persons has been raised too high; and
that these complaints, though not without
foundation, have been carried too far. But I
have other, and more momentous considerations
to suggest to you, on this subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

<p>At the revival of letters, when the manifold
corruptions of Christianity had been discovered,
it was too natural for the disabused
mind to entertain some suspicions of the revelation
itself; and when reason, now emancipated
from authority, had tried its strength,
and found itself able to detect innumerable errors
in religion and science, it too hastily concluded
that there was no subject too vast for
its comprehension, and that its power and
right to decide on all questions whatsoever was
evident and beyond dispute. From that suspicious,
and this delirious state of the human
mind, infidelity sprung up, and on either stock
it still grows. “We have been deceived in
many things, with regard to this religion;
therefore in every thing.” “We know much;
therefore we are capable of knowing all
things.”—These, as extravagant as they appear,
are the two sophisms, into which all modern
free-thinking is to be resolved.</p>

<p>But now it is so evident to men of sense,
that “a revelation may be true, though much
imposture has been grafted upon it, and that
its doctrines may challenge our belief, though
they be not within the reach of our knowledge.”
This, I say, is now so uncontroverted
among men of sense, that, if the list of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
those, who, in the course of two or three centuries,
have supported the infidel cause on
those grounds, were ever so great or so conspicuous,
it could furnish no argument, or
even presumption, in favour of that cause
itself.</p>

<p>But the truth is, that list is neither formidable
for its numbers, nor for the capacity of
those, of whom it consists. It shrinks into
nothing, when we oppose to it the multitudes
of able men, who have been, during this period,
and are, the advocates of Christianity;
and, among these, when we recollect the
names of Grotius, Pascal, Bacon, Locke,
Boyle, Newton, and many others (not of the
sacred order, though I know not why the authority
of these should be left out of the account);
when, I say, we look up to these great
lights and ornaments of the Christian world.</p>

<p>Nor let it be surmized, that the reasonings
of infidel writers have been better, or other,
than they are here represented to be, or that
they have not been enforced with full liberty,
and in all their strength. What the liberty,
or rather licence, of these enlightened times
has been, we all know: And of their arguments,
ye may all judge: though this labour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
be the less necessary, as most of them have not
only been triumphantly confuted by believers,
but successively exploded by unbelievers themselves;
and the rest of them, have not prevented
men of thought and ability from being
generally on the side of the Christian religion,
even to this day.</p>

<p>Ye see, I am as concise as possible, and
omit very much of what might be said on this
subject, not to exceed the limits usually prescribed
to a discourse in this place. But when
ye contemplate the present state of Christianity,
in an age of the greatest light and freedom,
and the respect that is still paid to it, I
must just desire you to call to mind the state
of pagan religion under the like circumstances;
and to reflect that, when men of sense examined
its pretensions in the Augustan age,
there was not a single person, in the priesthood
or out of it, of ability and learning, who
did not see and know that the whole was a
manifest imposture, and destitute of all evidence,
that could induce a well-grounded and
rational assent<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>. Can any thing like this be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
said, or even suspected, of the Christian
faith?</p>

<p>I know, that fraud and falsehood, by being
mixed with a great deal of acknowledged evident
truth, may obtain respect even with some
acute and inquisitive men; as, without doubt,
has been the case of Popery, since the Reformation:
I know, too, that a false religion,
unsupported by any truth, may even keep its
ground in a learned age, when restraint or
other causes have prevented a free inquiry into
that religion; as may have been the case of
Mahometanism, in one stage of the Saracen
empire: but that a religion, like the Christian,
as delivered in the Scriptures, which
must either be wholly false, or wholly true,
and has been scrutinized with the utmost freedom
and severity, should yet, if the arguments
for it were weak and fallacious, maintain its
credit, and subsist in the belief of the most
capable and accomplished reasoners, is, I think,
a prodigy, which never has appeared, or can
appear among men.</p>

<p>I suppose, enough has been, now, said to
shew, that, in fact, the knowledge of past or
present times has not discredited the cause of
Christianity; and that what there is of infidelity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
may be well accounted for from certain prevailing
prejudices, which unhappily sprung up
with returning Letters, at the Reformation. I
might go on to shew, that the evidences of the
Christian religion, as drawn out, and set before us,
by its modern apologists, are now
stronger, and more convincing, than they ever
were in any former period; and that, on the
whole, this religion has not lost, but gained
infinitely, by all the inquiries, which improved
science has enabled men of leisure and curiosity
to make into it. But it is time to return
to the <small>TEXT</small>, and to conclude this commentary
upon it, with one or two short reflexions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span>, if it be true, that after so many trials
of every kind, those especially of reason, and
philosophy, to which the religion of the Gospel
has been exposed, the belief of it remains
unshaken in the minds of men, Then is the
prophecy of the text thus far signally verified;
and it is indisputable, that <i>the gates of hell
have not</i>, hitherto, <i>prevailed against it</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Secondly</span>, if it be scarce imaginable that
any future trials, from without, should be
more severe, than those which Christianity
has already suffered; or that those, from within,
I mean the trials of severe rational inquiry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
should be more formidable, than what it has
undergone in two periods, the most distinguished
for the free exertion of the human faculties,
of any that have occurred in the history
of the world; then may it seem credible,
or rather then is the presumption strong and
cogent, that neither, hereafter, will the prophecy
be confuted, and that the <i>gates of hell
shall not</i>, at any time, or at all, <i>prevail
against it</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thirdly</span>, and lastly, We may learn, from
both these conclusions, to put our trust in this
impregnable fortress of our Religion; to embrace
with stedfastness, and to observe with
the utmost reverence, a <small>RULE OF FAITH AND
LIFE</small>, which bears the signatures of immortality
upon it, and appears to be under the special
protection, as it proceeded originally from the
special favour and authority, of God himself.</p>

<span class="medium">CHRIST’S DRIVING THE BUYERS AND
SELLERS OUT OF THE TEMPLE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span></p>

<p>I propose, in this discourse, to take into
consideration a very remarkable part of the
Gospel-history; in which Jesus is supposed to
have exercised an act of authority on some
persons, whom the Jews permitted to carry on
a certain traffic within the walls of the Temple.</p>

<p>I shall, <small>FIRST</small>, recite the several accounts,
which the sacred historians have given of this
transaction; and shall, <small>THEN</small>, hazard some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
observations, which will, perhaps, be found to
lessen, or to remove, the objections commonly
made to it.</p>

<p>I begin with St. John’s account of it, which is
delivered in these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ch. ii. 13-17.</p>

<p>“And the Jews passover was
at hand, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem, and found in the
temple those that sold oxen,
and sheep, and doves, and the
changers of money, sitting:
And when he had made a
scourge of small cords, he
drove them all out of the temple,
and the sheep and the
oxen; and poured out the
changers money, and overthrew
the tables; and said
unto them that sold doves,
Take these things hence; make
not my Father’s house an house
of merchandize. And his disciples
remembered that it was
written, The zeal of thine
house hath eaten me up.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Thus far the Evangelist, St. John: And the
order of the history shews, that this was done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
at the <i>first</i> Passover which Jesus attended, after
he had taken upon himself his prophetic office.</p>

<p>The other Evangelists relate a similar transaction,
which had happened at the Passover, immediately
preceding his crucifixion. Some
have imagined that, on this last occasion, the
same act was repeated by him, on two several
days; but I see no sufficient ground for that
supposition. St. Mark is easily reconciled with
St. Matthew and St. Luke by only admitting,
what is very usual in the sacred writers, some
little neglect of method in the narration of one
or other of those historians.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mat. xxi. 12, 13.</p>

<p>“And Jesus went into the
temple of God, and cast out
all them that sold and bought
in the temple, and overthrew
the tables of the money-changers,
and the seats of them
that sold doves, and said unto
them, it is written, My house
shall be called the house of
prayer, but ye have made it a
den of thieves.”</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Mark xi. 15-17.</p>

<p>“And they come to Jerusalem:
And Jesus went into the temple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
and began to cast out
them that sold and bought in
the temple, and overthrew the
tables of the money-changers,
and the seats of them that sold
doves; And would not suffer
that any man should carry any
vessel through the temple. And
he taught, saying unto them,
Is it not written, My house
shall be called of all nations
the house of prayer? But ye
have made it a den of thieves.”</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Luke xix. 45, 46.</p>

<p>“And he went into the temple,
and began to cast out
them that sold therein, and
them that bought, saying unto
them, It is written, My house
is the house of prayer: but ye
have made it a den of thieves.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In reading these passages, one is led to conclude,
that the <small>ACT</small> itself, here ascribed to our
Lord, was of no small importance; for it is related,
we see, by every one of the four Evangelists.
The substance of what we learn from all
of them, compared together, is this: “That
Jesus, at two several times, <i>once</i>, before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
first Passover which he attended after the entrance
on his ministry, and <i>again</i>, before the
Passover which preceded his passion, went up
to Jerusalem, and entered into the <i>temple</i>;
that is (as all interpreters agree, and as the
nature of the thing speaks) into the <i>first</i>, or
outermost court of the temple, or that which
was called <i>the court of the Gentiles</i>; because
the Gentiles, who acknowledged the one true
God, were permitted to come and worship him
there; that in this court (which was separated
from the next or second court by a sept or low
wall, and deemed by the Jews <i>prophane</i>, in
contempt of the Gentiles, to whose use it was
dedicated) <i>he found those that sold oxen and
sheep and doves, and the changers of money</i>;
that is, persons who attended there to furnish
what was necessary for the service of the temple,
and so made a kind of market, of this first
court or division of it: that, upon observing this
prophanation, <i>he made a scourge of small cords</i>,
or, as the word in the original strictly means,
of <i>rushes</i>, such as he may be supposed to have
found upon the spot, and with this scourge
drove these traffickers from their station;
signifying, by this and such like actions, his
displeasure at this pollution of a part of the
temple; and saying to them, withall, <i>It is
written, My house shall be called the house of
prayer of all nations: But ye have made it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
an house of merchandize</i>, or, as the equivalent
expression is, <i>a den of thieves</i>.”</p>

<p>Thus stands the history itself: And the light
in which it is commonly understood, is this;
“That Jesus, in virtue of his prophetic, or, if
you will, <i>regal</i> character, did this act of
authority, to testify his zeal for the honour of
God’s house, thus polluted and desecrated, contrary
to its original purpose and design, by the
base and commercial uses, that were now made
of it;” and it is probable, that the Disciples
themselves, <i>at the time</i>, considered it in this
light, only, <i>for they remembered</i>, St. John says,
<i>that it was written, The zeal of thine house
hath eaten me up</i>—applying a passage out of
the Psalms, to this act of zeal in their master.</p>

<p>It is true, this circumstance is only related by
St. John, who records the <i>former</i> transaction,
and omits the <i>latter</i>: the reason of this difference
will, perhaps, be seen, as we proceed in
our inquiry.</p>

<p>But to this solution of the case some objections
have been made.</p>

<p>Besides the strangeness and indecency, as
many apprehend, of the proceeding itself, and
the improbability that the persons concerned in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
this chastisement, who had public allowance for
what they did, should patiently submit to it (for
we hear of no resistance, nor of any complaint,
made by them)—Besides, I say, these obvious
considerations, the act itself was an act of
<small>CIVIL POWER</small>, which Jesus always disclaimed,
and for which, it will be said, he had no
warrant, either from the ruling Jews, themselves,
or from his regal, or prophetic character:
not, from <i>the ruling Jews</i>, who, we know,
were offended at his behaviour; not, from his
<i>regal</i> character, which was not of this world;
nor yet, lastly, from his <i>prophetic</i> office: for,
though that might authorize him to declare his
sense of this prophanation, it may be thought
not to extend so far as to justify him in disturbing
the civil rights of men, and doing a direct
violence to their property and persons. Jesus
himself, we understand, was so tender of <i>both</i>,
that, upon another occasion, when it was proposed
to him to divide a contested inheritance
between two claimants, he said to the proposer,
<i>Man, who made me a judge, or a divider over
you</i><a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>? Whence it may seem reasonable to infer,
that he would not have interposed, by an overt
act of authority or jurisdiction, in <i>this</i> case; notwithstanding
the reference it had to the honour
of religion, or the right he might have to condemn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
an abusive practice, from his spiritual
character.</p>

<p>These difficulties seem to shew, that there is
something more in the case, than a mere expression
of zeal against the prophaners of the
temple: not but this might be one end, but it
could not be the sole or even principal end, of
so extraordinary a transaction.</p>

<p>I do not indeed find, that the ancient commentators
on the Gospels have said any thing
to the difficulties, I have mentioned. They
seem to have looked no further than to the obvious
sense of this transaction, and to have acquiesced
in the opinion of its being intended to
evidence our Lord’s zeal for the honour of God’s
house, without any further view or purpose
whatsoever. They found it related as a matter
of fact; and they piously admitted the authority
of Jesus to controul the civil usages and
rights of the Jews, by virtue of his transcendant
power and divine character.</p>

<p>But the moderns have been aware of the objections,
which lie against this interpretation.
Our learned Selden, in particular, has an entire
chapter, in his book <i>De jure naturali et gentium
juxta disciplinam Hebræorum</i>, on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
subject<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>. His notion is, That Jesus exerted
this act of power, in virtue of what the Jews
called <span class="smcap">The right or privilege of zealots</span><a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>;
by which they meant, not a general zeal or indignation
(such as is before spoken of) against
what they conceived to be derogatory to the
honour of their religion; but a <i>right</i>, strictly
so called, derived to them from the civil institutions
and approved usages of their country,
of interfering, in some extraordinary cases, to
repel a manifest insult on their law, by private
force, without waiting for the slow process of a
judicial determination.</p>

<p>The principal, or rather sole foundation, on
which this notion is erected, is the case of <i>Phinehas</i>,
related in the book of <span class="smcap">Numbers</span><a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>: which
the Jews afterwards construed into a <i>law</i>, or
embraced at least as a <i>traditionary</i> rule of conduct,
derived to them, as they supposed, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
the times of Moses. But this case will by no
means bear the construction, which has been
made of it. For,</p>

<p>1. It was a single and very <i>particular</i> case,
without any intimation from the historian, that
it was afterwards to be drawn into precedent.</p>

<p>2. It may seem to have been, if not commanded,
yet in some measure authorized, or it
was at least, by an express revelation, afterwards
justified. For the matter is thus related. Upon
the defection of the Israelites at Shittim into
idolatry, in consequence of their prophane, as
well as impure commerce with <i>the daughters
of Moab</i>, God sent a plague among them, and
besides commanded Moses to put to death all
those who had been guilty of such abominations.
Moses obeyed, and <i>said unto the
judges of Israel, slay ye every one his men,
that were joined unto Baal-Peor</i>.</p>

<p>This command was issued very properly to
the <i>Judges</i>: but a <i>private</i> man, <i>Phinehas, the
son of Eleazer, the son of Aaron the priest</i>,
instigated by his zeal, and presuming perhaps
on his relationship to the high priest (from whose
family, a more than ordinary zeal in such a case
might be expected) did, under these circumstances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
take upon himself to execute that command
on two persons, surprized in the very
act, for which the penalty had been denounced,
in the presence of all the people. Now, though
this proceeding was irregular in itself, yet the
notoriety of the fact, the most atrocious that
could be, and the most daring insult on the
divine authority, seemed almost to supersede
the necessity of a legal process. The consequence
was, that God himself was pleased to
accept and reward the deed, because the author
of it, on such a provocation, and at such a time,
<i>was zealous for his God, and had made an
atonement for the children of Israel</i>.</p>

<p>But to argue from a single instance, so circumstanced,
that the same zeal was allowable
in other cases, in which no such countenance
had been given, and no such necessity or provocation
could be pretended, is evidently so
unreasonable, that no stress ought to be laid on
this argument. The Jews, indeed, in succeeding
times, might fancy a general rule to
have been implied in this single instance; and
we know from their history, to what enormous
excesses this their easy belief, concurring with
a natural violence of temper, afterwards transported
them, during the last calamities of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
this devoted people<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>: but our Lord was very
unlikely to give a countenance to their traditions,
or to add the sanction of his authority to
a principle, so weakly founded, and so liable to
the worst abuse.</p>

<p>3. This <i>traffic of the merchants</i>, in the
court of the Gentiles, how unfit soever it might
be, depended on the same authority, as this
pretended <i>right itself of the zealots</i>; that is,
on the allowed usage and constant discipline of
their country. No express precept of the law
could be alledged for either. So that this <i>right</i>
could not be exerted but at the expence of <i>another</i>,
equally well founded.</p>

<p>4. Mr. Selden himself appears to have had
some distrust of his own hypothesis, by the
care he takes to interweave, in his discourse, a
charge of <i>fraud</i> on the merchants, together
with their <i>prophanation</i> of the temple. But
the learned writer forgets, that <small>ZELOTISM</small> (if I
may have leave to use a new term) respected
<i>religion</i> only, and not private morals. For
even <i>the act of zeal</i>, performed by Phinehas
(from which, only, the very idea of this <i>Jewish
right</i>, if it were one, was derived) had, for its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
object, not the <i>fornication</i> simply, but the
<i>idolatry</i>, of the criminals: it was a sacrifice,
not to the honour of <i>virtue</i>, as such, but to
the <i>honour of God</i>. And, indeed, nothing
but the singular structure of the Jewish polity,
in which the honour of God was so extraordinarily
considered, could give any the least colour
to the <i>fiction</i> of such a right.</p>

<p>5. <i>Lastly</i>, whatever degree of credit this
principle of <i>zelotism</i> might have acquired
among the Jews, it was very unlikely, perhaps
we may say, impossible, that Jesus should act
upon it. When the Disciples, <i>James</i> and
<i>John</i>, on a certain occasion, were instigated
by this <i>zeal</i> to call for fire from Heaven on the
heads of some persons, who had offered an
insult to their master, Jesus himself rebuked
them in these terms—<i>Ye know not what
spirit ye are of: For the Son of man is not
come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them</i>
[Luke ix. 55.]—To <i>burn with fire</i>, is indeed
something more than, <i>to scourge</i>: but, though
the vengeance be not equal, in these two instances,
the <i>spirit</i> is the same from which it is
derived, and by which it is justified: and this
<i>spirit</i>, we are expressly told, is not that by
which Jesus chose to conduct himself. It was
to no purpose to alledge the case of a Phinehas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
or even an Elias: these were no precedents for
<small>HIM</small>, who <i>came not to destroy men’s lives, but
to save them</i>.</p>

<p>I conclude then, upon the whole, that Jesus
did not perform this act of driving the merchants
out of the temple, in the Jewish character
of <small>ZEALOT</small>; in what <i>other</i> character
he might possibly perform it, I shall now inquire.</p>

<p>The ingenious conjecture of Mr. Selden, already
considered, was apparently taken up by
him to avoid the difficulties which he found in
accounting for this act of zeal in our Lord, from
his <i>prophetic</i> character only. These difficulties,
he saw very distinctly, and has explained with
much force.</p>

<p>“Though the Saviour of the world, says he,
was undoubtedly both God and King, and,
by his absolute dominion, not over the Jews
only, but the whole race of mankind, must be
supposed to have had a right of doing whatever
he saw fit to do; yet since we know, that he
constantly submitted himself in all things to
the established forms of civil justice, whether
of Jewish, or Roman institution; and, as being
desirous to exhibit in his own person a most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
absolute example of obedience to the course of
human authority, was careful always to abstain
from every thing, that might be thought a
violation of it in any private man; since, besides,
we know, that, considering the peculiar
envy, to which his life was exposed, he could
not possibly have gratified his enemies more,
than by putting it in their power to bring a
criminal charge against him: it must, on all
these accounts, be thought reasonable to suppose,
that our Lord would not have ventured
on so extraordinary an act, as that of driving
the merchants out of the temple, unless it had
been such, as, even in the opinion of those
who were most prejudiced against him, he might
lawfully and regularly perform<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span></p>

<p>All this, the reader sees, is prudently,
piously, and ably said, by this very learned
writer; and I readily subscribe to every word
of it. We only differ in our conclusion from
these premises. Mr. Selden holds, that what
Jesus did on this occasion, <i>cannot</i> be reconciled
to the idea of his <small>PROPHETIC CHARACTER</small>,
as sustained by him in the course of his ministry:
I, on the contrary, conceive, that it
very well <i>may</i>. But then I consider that <i>character</i>,
as exercised by our Lord, at this time,
in <i>another manner</i>, and to <i>other ends</i>, than
the learned writer supposed.</p>

<p>In a word, I see Jesus in the light, not of a
<small>ZEALOT</small>, but of a <small>PROPHET</small> only, in this whole
transaction. I see him acting, not on precarious
principles and rabbinical traditions, but
on the sure basis of scripture; and regulating
his conduct by the known ideas of his office,
such as had at all times been entertained of it,
and were even now familiar to the Jews in the
times in which he lived.</p>

<p>To make way for what I have further to
advance on this subject, it will, then, be necessary
to consider, <i>first</i>, the <small>PRACTICES AND
USAGES</small> of the Jewish prophets, I mean the
<i>manner</i>, in which that high office was sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
discharged and exercised by them, even
to the very times in question: and, <i>secondly</i>,
to consider, the true scope and meaning of the
<small>PROPHECY</small> itself, to which Jesus appeals, and
on which he justifies this obnoxious part of his
conduct.</p>

<p>1. It is impossible for those, who have read
the scriptures of the Old Testament, not to
observe, how much they abound in figures and
material images. Nay, the prophets are frequently
represented as instructing those, to
whom they are sent, not in figurative expression
only, but in the way of action and by
sensible signs. And this mode of information
has been shewn by learned men<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> to arise from
the very nature of language, in its rude and
imperfect state; being indeed an apt and necessary
expedient to supply the defects of
speech, under that circumstance. It has further
been made appear, from the history of
mankind, that this practice universally prevailed
in all barbarous nations, as well as in
Judæa; nay, that it every where <i>continued</i> to
prevail, as an ornamental method of communication,
long after the necessity was over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
which had given birth to it; especially among
the inhabitants of the East, to whose natural
vivacity it was so well suited. Hence, the
Jewish prophets, it is said, but conformed to
the established practice of their own times,
when they adopted this use of representative
action: as, when one Prophet <i>pushed with
horns of iron</i>, to denote the overthrow of the
Syrians<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>; and another, <i>broke a potter’s vessel
to pieces</i>, to express the shattered fortune of
the Jews<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>; with innumerable other instances
of the like nature.</p>

<p>This the prophet Hosea calls, using <i>similitudes
by the</i> <small>HAND</small> <i>of the prophets</i><a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>; and the
effect of it was, to impress the proposed information
on the minds of men with more
force (being addressed to their eyes and senses)
than could have been done by a mere verbal
explication.</p>

<p>This mode of teaching by signs, then, let
it be remembered, was familiar to the Jewish
nation, and prevailed even in the days of Jesus;
as is clear from John the Baptist’s <i>wearing a
garment of camel’s hair, and eating locusts and
wild honey</i><a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>; to signify the mortification<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
and repentance, which he was commissioned
to preach—from Christ’s <i>riding into Jerusalem</i><a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>;
to signify the assumption of his regal
office—and from his directing his disciples to
<i>shake of the dust of their feet<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>, as a testimony
against them</i>, who would not receive his
Gospel.</p>

<p>And we find that, sometimes, even a miracle
was wrought to furnish a convenient <i>sign</i>—As
when Simon’s <i>draught of fishes</i><a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>, was
made to denote the success he should have in
his ministry; according to the interpretation of
Christ himself, who said to him, <i>Henceforth
thou shalt catch men</i>—As, again, when Jesus
<i>curst the barren fig-tree</i><a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>, to signify the unfruitfulness
and rejection of the Jewish nation—And,
as when he permitted <i>the unclean
spirits to enter into a herd of swine</i>, which,
thereupon, <i>ran violently down a steep place
and perished in the waters</i><a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>: an exertion of
his miraculous power, which, among other
purposes, might be intended to express, in the
way of <i>representation</i>, the tyranny of evil
spirits, and their attendants, evil habits, over
sensual and voluptuous men (of whom <i>swine</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
are the acknowledged emblems), and the consequent
<i>perdition in which they drown them</i>.
Nay, the very parables of our Lord, are but
this mode of information, by material signs,
once removed.</p>

<p>It may, further, be observed, that the two
Christian Sacraments themselves are founded
on this principle: and so prevalent was the
use of conveying information in this form, that
even the Roman Governor, when he condemned
Jesus, <i>took water and washed his hands<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> before
the multitude</i>, to signify to them, that
he was innocent of that horrid crime.</p>

<p>From all this we may certainly conclude,
that it was very customary in our Saviour’s
time for men to express themselves by outward
and visible signs: that this mode of expression
was especially of ancient and approved
use among the Prophets, when they would inforce
some high and important topic of instruction:
and that, not impossibly therefore, the
famous transaction in the temple may be only
an information of this nature.</p>

<p>If then we would know, what that <i>information</i>
was, or, in other words, what was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
peculiar <i>object</i> of it, it will be proper, in the
next place,</p>

<p>2. To turn to the <span class="smcap">Prophecy</span>, to which Jesus
appeals, and to consider the true scope and
purpose of it.</p>

<p>The prophecies of Isaiah, it is well known,
are chiefly taken up in predicting the future
glories of Christ’s kingdom, of which <i>the call
of the Gentiles</i> makes a conspicuous and shining
part. This great event is foretold in a vast
variety of places; and in different forms of expression,
one while, plain and direct, at other times,
figurative and obscure. The Messiah is spoken of
as <i>bringing forth judgement to the Gentiles</i>;
and more clearly still, as <i>being given for a
light to the Gentiles</i><a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>. In other places, the
expression is ænigmatical; as where the Heathen
are mentioned as <i>prisoners</i>, who shall be
set at liberty<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>—as <i>strangers</i>, who should
build up the walls of Jerusalem<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>—<i>as blind
people that have eyes, and deaf that have
ears</i><a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>—and under a multitude of other
images.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span></p>

<p>Full of these ideas, the Prophet begins the
fifty-sixth chapter with the following triumphant
exhortation—<i>Thus saith the Lord, Keep
ye judgment, and do justice, for my salvation
is near to come, and my righteousness to be
revealed</i>; the very language, almost, in which
the Baptist afterwards announced our Saviour
to the Jews: whence it may appear, of <i>what</i>
salvation the Prophet is here speaking. But
to <i>whom</i> is this salvation promised? Why, in
general, to those <i>who keep the Sabbath from
polluting it</i>, ver. 2; that is, in the prophetic
style, to those who should embrace the Christian
faith: for the <i>Sabbath</i> being the sign or
token of God’s covenant with the Jews, hence
the prophets transfer this idea to the Christian
Covenant; and, by <i>keeping the Sabbath</i>, they
express the observance of that future covenant,
to which mankind should be admitted under the
ministry of Jesus.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, the Jews <i>only</i> were to be admitted
to this new covenant of salvation. The
prophet expressly asserts the contrary: for not
only the Jews of the captivity (to whom we are
to suppose the course of the prophecy to be
immediately directed) are concerned in this
salvation, but <small>THE SONS OF THE STRANGER</small>, that
is, the Gentiles (whom the Jews always considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
under the idea of <i>Strangers</i>, just as
the Greeks did the rest of the world, under that
of <i>Barbarians</i>)—<i>Even them</i> (says the Prophet,
speaking in the person of God) <i>will I
bring to my holy mountain</i>, ver. 7, and make
them joyful <i>in my house of prayer: their
burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be
accepted on my altar</i>. The language is still
<i>Jewish</i>, according to the prophetic style, which
describes the Christian dispensation under
Jewish ideas: but by <i>holy mountain</i> is meant
the Church of Christ; and by <i>Sacrifices</i>, the
spiritual services of that new œconomy. And,
to make this purpose of his prophecy the clearer,
he even departs, in one instance, from his
<i>legal</i> manner of expression, in saying, <i>I will
make them joyful in my</i> <small>HOUSE OF PRAYER</small>;
which is a spiritual and Christian idea; the
Jewish temple being properly a <i>house of sacrifice</i>,
and not of <i>prayer</i>; for which last service
there is no express precept in the law. And
then follows the prophecy, quoted by Jesus, as
explanatory of what he was then doing—<i>for
mine house shall be called an house of prayer
for all people</i>. The prophet, as solicitous to
be understood, repeats and marks out this distinction:
I spoke of it, says he, as my house
of prayer, <i>For my house shall</i> [in those latter
days] <i>be called</i> [that is, shall <i>be</i>] a <i>house of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
prayer</i>, and that too, <i>for all people</i>; that is,
not for the Jews only, but for <i>all the Gentiles</i>.
And, as if all this were not still clear enough,
he adds—<i>The Lord God, which gathereth the
outcasts of Israel</i>, the Jews dispersed in the
captivity, <i>saith, Yet I will gather</i> <small>OTHERS</small> <i>to
him, besides those that are gathered him</i>,
ver. 8. that is, the Gentiles.</p>

<p>This famous text, then, is clearly a prediction
of the call of the Gentiles into the
Church of Christ, a prediction of that great
event which should take place under the new
dispensation, when the Jewish enclosure was
to be laid open, and all men indifferently, the
Gentiles, as well as the Jews, were to be admitted
into the Christian covenant.</p>

<p>It is true, our English version of this text,
quoted by our Lord, very much obscures, or
rather perverts, its sense. It stands thus in the
Gospel of St. Mark—<i>My house shall be called
of all nations the house of prayer</i>, xi. 17.
Whence it appears, that our translators considered
this text, as describing only the <i>destination</i>
of the Jewish temple, and not as predicting
the <i>genius</i> of the Christian religion.
But the scope of the prophecy, as above explained,
and the Greek text itself, clearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
shews that it ought to have been rendered
thus—<i>My house shall be called a house of
prayer for all the Gentiles</i>: ὁ οἶκός μου,
οἶκος προσευχῆς κληθήσεται πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσιν.</p>

<p>Thus much being premised, both <i>of the
prophetic manner of teaching by signs</i>, and <i>of
the true meaning of this prophecy</i>, let us see
now what light these considerations afford to
our present subject.</p>

<p>Jesus enters into that court of the temple,
which was called <i>the court of the Gentiles</i>;
who had leave to worship the God of Israel
there, but were permitted to advance no further.
This <i>court</i>, he finds polluted by the
sale of beasts, and the traffic of merchants; the
Jews, in their sovereign contempt of these
poor heathen, not only excluding them from their
own place of worship, but debasing them still
farther by the allowance of this sordid society
to mix with them. What is the conduct of
our Lord, on this occasion! Why, agreeably
to his prophetic character, he declares himself
sent to break through all these exclusive privileges
and distinctions; to accomplish that
great mystery, which the old prophets had so
much and so triumphantly spoken of, as reserved
to be revealed by him; and to admit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
the Heathen to an equal participation of the
blessings, which the Gospel-covenant was to
dispense, with the Jewish people.</p>

<p>But, in what manner does he declare this
purpose? Why, he <i>makes a scourge of small
cords</i>, and, by the representative action of
driving this prophane company out of the
temple, shews that he is come to break down
that partition-wall, which separated the Gentile
and the Jewish worshippers, to vindicate the
despised Heathen from the insults offered to
them, and to lay open the means of salvation
to all people. <i>He began to cast out them that
sold therein and them that bought, saying to
them, It is written, My house shall be called
a house of prayer for all the Gentiles.</i> The
action, we see, is used as <i>expressive</i> of his
design; and his <i>design</i> is clearly ascertained,
by applying to himself the express words of
Isaiah. The whole is, then, <i>a prophetic information,
by way of action</i>, of the genius of
Christianity, which was to extend its benefits
even to the Gentiles.</p>

<p>I have before acknowledged, that a <i>secondary</i>
purpose of this transaction might be, to give
the Jews to understand, how culpable they had
been in permitting even a lawful traffic to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
carried on in any part of their temple. For it
was usual with Jesus to accomplish several ends
by the same act, and even to lay the greatest
apparent stress on that end, which was not first
in his intention: of which some examples may
hereafter be given. But the primary design of
<i>this</i> act (and but for the sake of which it
would not have been undertaken) I suppose,
was, to point out the diffusive nature and influence
of his spiritual kingdom.</p>

<p>It may be said, perhaps, that, if such was
the intention of Jesus, it had been more properly
and significantly expressed by a different
act, I mean, by that <i>of bringing the Heathen
into the temple</i>, rather than <i>of driving the
merchants out of it</i>. But we are to reflect,
that, as the Heathen were already permitted
to come into this part of the temple (and it
would have given, at this time, too great a
shock to the prejudices of the Jews, to have
carried them into any other), that act would
have conveyed no new information; it being
on all hands agreed that the devout Heathen
might worship there. The business was, to
shew that their religious privileges were, hereafter,
to be the same with those of the Jews;
and that no more contempt was to be countenanced,
towards the one, than the other.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
All distinctions were to cease; and this information
was, therefore, most fitly conveyed by
an act, which expressed the same regard for
the court of the Gentiles, as for the court of
the Jews: that is, the honour of each is equally
asserted, and no prophanation allowed of
either.</p>

<p>In further confirmation of the sense, here
given to this transaction, it may be observed,
that the relation of it is joined, or rather interwoven
with that other of his <i>cursing the
barren fig-tree</i>: which was plainly an emblem,
and so is <i>confessed</i> to be, of <i>the rejection of
the Jews</i>; just as that we have been considering
is <i>presumed</i> to be, of <i>the call of the Gentiles</i>:
these two things being closely connected in the
order of God’s dispensations. Whence St. Paul
speaks of the one, as the consequence of the
other; of <i>the fall of the Jews</i>, as <i>the riches
of the world</i>; and of <i>the loss of the Jews</i>, as
<i>the riches of the Gentiles</i><a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>. Now, if we turn
to St. Mark, we there find<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>, that the <i>fig-tree
is cursed</i>, as Jesus is coming from Bethany to
Jerusalem—that, when he came to Jerusalem,
he went into the temple, and <i>drove out the
money-changers</i>, &amp;c.—and that the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
morning, when he and his disciples were returning
the same way, <i>as they passed by, they
saw the fig tree dried up from the roots</i><a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>.</p>

<p>If then it be allowed, that Christ meant, by
the <i>sign</i> of the blasted <i>fig-tree</i> (the story of
which is so remarkably incorporated with that
other of purging the temple), to express and
predict <i>the rejection of the Jews</i>, how natural
is it to suppose that, in purging the temple, he
meant to express and predict, by another
sign, <i>the vocation of the Gentiles</i>! Or, if
there be still any doubt in the case, Christ’s
own parable of the <i>Vineyard</i> (which follows
close in the history<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>) will effectually remove
it. For the application of this parable is made
by Christ himself to <small>BOTH</small> these subjects<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>—<i>What
shall the Lord of the Vineyard do?—He
shall come and destroy</i> <small>THOSE</small> <i>husbandmen,
and shall give the Vineyard to</i> <small>OTHERS</small>—That
is, He shall <span class="smcap">reject the Jews</span>, and <span class="smcap">admit
the Gentiles</span>: an interpretation, so clear
and certain that the Jews themselves could not
avoid seeing it; <i>for they perceived that he had
spoken this parable against them</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span></p>

<p>But I think it appears, from the conduct of
the ruling Jews, on occasion of what had passed
in the temple, that it was well understood for
<i>what general purpose</i>, and under <i>what character</i>,
Jesus had exhibited that extraordinary
scene. For they presently come to him, and
say, <i>By what authority doest thou these things,
and who gave thee this authority<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>?</i> That this
question relates to <i>what things</i> he had done in
the temple, when he applied the scourge to
the merchants, the context clearly shews; and
is indeed beyond all doubt, since we find the
same question put to him, and almost in the
same words, when he had performed this act
before, at the first Passover: <i>Then answered
the Jews, and said unto him, What sign shewest
thou unto us, seeing thou doest these
things<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>?</i></p>

<p>Now, if the Jews had seen this transaction
in the light of an <i>act of authority</i> or of <i>violence</i>
against the persons of the merchants, it neither
agreed with their <i>character</i>, nor indeed with
their <i>principles</i>, to put this question. <i>The
chief priests and elders of the people</i> are the
persons who interrogate Jesus in this manner<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
and would they, who constantly <i>laid wait for
him, that they might accuse him</i><a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>, let slip so
fair an opportunity of citing him before the
magistrate, as a disturber of the public peace,
and a violater of their civil rights and customs?
Instead of taking this obvious advantage against
him, they at once drop all the malice of their
character, and only ask him, in the way of
civil and almost friendly expostulation, <i>By what
authority he did these things</i>. It is certain,
they never had so specious a pretence, as this
affair administered to them, of bringing a public
accusation against him. Yet it seems never
once to have entered into their thoughts. Nor
can it be said, that they stood in awe of the
<i>people</i> (as they sometimes did, when they
were enough disposed to lay hands on him);
for the people, in this case, when so free an
attack was made on their privileges, as well
as prejudices, would naturally be on their
side.</p>

<p>But neither would their <i>Principles</i> suffer
them to put this question. Jesus had, as they
conceived, committed a flagrant act of injustice,
in assaulting the persons of men, who were
under the protection of the state: and they call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
upon him only for <i>a sign, since he did these
things</i>. Is it credible that men, so attached,
as they were, to their own laws and customs,
should demand, or accept a <i>sign</i>, in such a
juncture? Could all Paul’s miracles justify him,
in their opinion, for <i>not walking after their
customs</i><a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>? Or, would a <i>sign</i> from heaven, of
how transcendant a nature soever, have absolved
Jesus in their apprehension, from a
crime, so palpably proved upon him? They
would certainly have said, as they did say on
another occasion, <i>We have a Law</i>, which forbids
all offences of this sort; and <i>by that Law</i>, he
ought to be tried and judged.</p>

<p>Thus, I think, the matter stands, if the
Jews had regarded Jesus, in the light of a
<span class="smcap">Criminal</span>. On the other hand, if they saw
him only in the light of a <span class="smcap">Prophet</span>, of one
who <i>assumed</i> that character, and had now, in
the way of his office, employed this act to
convey some important information to them,
their conduct was very natural in demanding
some proof of his being what he pretended to
be: and that proof, could be no other than a
<i>sign</i>, or miracle; which was the proper evidence
of his being a person sent from God.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
This evidence, indeed, of his prophetic mission
had already been given to the Jews, in the <i>signs</i>,
or miracles, which he had wrought among
them. But they wanted more than a general
conviction of his being invested with the prophetic
character. They were anxious to know
by what <i>authority</i> he did <small>THESE THINGS</small>; in
other words, what <i>Commission</i> he had, and how
it came to be in his commission, to put the
Jews and Gentiles on a level. A prophet he
might be; but not a prophet, authorized to
declare himself so roundly, as by this expressive
act he had done, against the peculiar people of
God, and in favour of the despised heathen. Of
his commission to publish such a doctrine, as
this, it was no ordinary <i>sign</i> that would satisfy
them. They pressed him, therefore, for some
<i>sign</i>, purposely and expressly wrought for this
end; some <i>sign</i>, so extraordinary in itself, and
so peculiarly adapted to the nature of the case,
as to furnish an immediate and decisive answer
to their demand, <i>Who gave thee</i> <small>THIS</small> <i>authority</i>?</p>

<p>This question our blessed Lord thought fit
to elude (for reasons, which will, in part, appear
in the progress of this discourse) at both
the times, when it was proposed to him: once,
by referring them to the authority of John the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
Baptist: and, again, by referring them (but
in ænigmatic terms) to his own resurrection.
Yet even <i>the Baptist</i> would have let them into
some part of the secret, which they desired to
penetrate; for, knowing the master-prejudice
of his countrymen, he addressed them in these
remarkable words—<i>Think not to say within
yourselves, We have Abraham for our Father:
for I say unto you, God is able even of</i> <small>THESE
STONES</small><a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> <i>to raise up children unto Abraham</i><a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>.
And then, for the miracle of his own <i>resurrection</i>,
that would not only be the fullest proof of
his prophetic mission, but would, at the same
time, be the completion of what he was now
signifying to them, by this prophetic act: for
the spiritual kingdom of the Messiah, into
which all the nations were to be admitted, was
to take place from that event. <i>Destroy</i>, says
he, <i>this temple</i>, [meaning, as we are told, <i>the
temple of his body</i>] <i>and in three days I will
build it up</i><a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>. So that, although Jesus refused
to gratify his questioners by working instantly
before them the <i>sign</i>, which they demanded:
yet he refers them to <i>such</i> a sign, which would
be wrought in due time, and to the very purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
of their inquiry; that is, it would be a
sign, which should, <i>both</i>, demonstrate his
prophetic commission to declare, by this <i>significant
act</i>, the favour which God intended to
confer on the Gentiles, and should, <i>also</i>, realize
his declaration, or set before them <i>the thing
signified</i>. Such is the force of that divine
answer—<i>Destroy this temple, and in three
days I will build it up</i>.</p>

<p>Where, by the way, we may, further, observe,
that the <i>symbolic language</i>, in which
he here predicts his resurrection, not being at
all apprehended by the Jews, was afterwards
made the foundation of a charge against him, as
if he had entertained the criminal <i>design</i> of
destroying the temple of Jerusalem<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>. How
much more would his enemies have laid hold on
this symbolic <i>act</i>, which he performed in the
temple, in order to found a charge of sedition
against him, if they had not conceived of him
as acting in the character of a <i>prophet</i> only,
and so had clearly comprehended, at least, the
<i>general</i> scope and meaning of that act!</p>

<p>That it was taken in this light, I mean, of a
<i>prophetic action</i>, by the very persons on whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
this seeming outrage was committed, may be
reasonably presumed, since they make no resistance
to it, nor complain of any injury, done
them by it: a conduct, very strange and unlikely,
if the parties concerned had received any
considerable damage: or if they conceived that
any <i>intended</i> violence had been offered to them.
It is plain, they considered the whole transaction,
as a piece of <i>scenery</i>, or representation
only; under the cover of which, Christ proposed,
in the manner of the Eastern sages, and
especially of the Jewish prophets, to convey
some momentous information to them, and to
impress it with much force and energy on their
minds.</p>

<p>Nor can it be concluded from the narration
of the Evangelists, that any thing more was intended
by their master. They relate this adventure,
simply as <i>a matter of fact</i>; and it
could not well be related otherwise, for the <i>information</i>
was given in the <i>fact</i>. They intermix,
indeed, no explanation; because they
probably saw not, any more than the generality
of the by-standers, the <i>specific</i> information,
it was meant to convey. They only saw, in
general, that <i>some</i> information was the end and
purpose of the act. The ruling Jews, who interrogated
Jesus concerning this act, I have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
doubt, saw or suspected, at least, the real drift
of it. But, as Jesus could not be brought to
explain himself by any direct answer, they were
left to their own conclusions about it: and were
content, we may suppose, to keep these conclusions
to themselves: the rather, as the turn,
which our Lord thought fit to give to this act, as
if it respected only the honour of God’s house,
put it out of their power to charge that other
meaning, decisively, upon him.</p>

<p>We may further observe, that the <i>history</i>
of this fact is not to be construed with the
utmost rigour. Some of the evangelists express
themselves in such terms, as, in the strict sense
of them, imply, that Jesus actually drove all
the beasts and traffickers out of the temple.
But we need only suppose that he applied himself
to this action, <i>as if</i> his purpose had been
actually to drive them all out: and that he continued
to employ himself in it in such sort,
and for so long a time, as that the persons present
might take notice of what he did, and so be
able (I do not say immediately, but in due
season) to interpret this <i>sign</i>, together with
Isaiah’s <i>prophecy</i>, in the manner he intended.
I say, <i>we need only suppose this</i>: because if no
more was done by Jesus, the Evangelists, in
their concise and simple way of narration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
would naturally express themselves, as they
have done, their accounts of this fact; and I
believe, if we consider the accounts we have of
many other informations <i>by action</i>, recorded in
the old Scriptures, we shall find it necessary to
understand them with some such restrictions
and qualifications.</p>

<p>If, after all, it be thought, that some <i>violence</i>
was offered to the merchants, and that
some <i>inconvenience</i> was suffered by them, in
consequence of it; I suppose they deserved
this punishment for their pollution of the
temple; and I admit that the prophetic character
of Jesus authorized him, in the course of
his ministry, to inflict it; just as, without doubt,
it authorized him to destroy the barren <i>fig-tree</i>,
when it served his purpose to discharge a part of
his office by making use of that <i>emblem</i>, though it
might be with some loss to the proprietor of it.
The case was the same here, when he drove
the traffickers from their station. But there is
a wide difference between supposing the <i>violence</i>,
offered to them, to be the <i>direct and
proper purpose</i> of the act, and the <i>incidental
effect</i> of it. And the silence of the merchants
themselves, under this violence, sufficiently
shews, as I observed, that they <i>felt</i> this difference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span></p>

<p>But the main difficulty, perhaps, is still behind.
For, it will be asked, Why was this
<i>mysterious</i> method used by our Saviour at all,
in conveying the supposed momentous information,
when he might have expressed his meaning
<i>directly</i>, in plain words?</p>

<p>1. One reason, I suppose, might be, the
inveterate and insurmountable prejudices of
the Jewish converts to this part of the Messiah’s
character. For, though the prophets
had given frequent, and sometimes the most
clear, descriptions of it: yet, so possessed were
they with the notion of their <i>being</i>, and of
their <i>continuing</i> to be, even under the dispensation
of their Messiah, a chosen and peculiar
people, that they never could hear (no, not
the Apostles themselves, till enlightened by
the holy Spirit, and by a special revelation for
that purpose; they could never hear, I say)
without the utmost indignation, <i>That God
had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles</i><a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>.
This indirect information was then in condescension
to the weakness of his own disciples
and followers.</p>

<p>And of this tenderness to their infirmities
we have a remarkable instance in the case of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
the <i>fig-tree</i>, so often mentioned; the drift of
which was unquestionably to denote the approaching
<i>rejection of the Jews</i>, for their unfruitfulness
under the means of grace, and
their rejection of the Messiah. But, the minds
of the disciples being too infirm, at this time,
to bear the open communication of so mortifying
a truth, Jesus purposely diverts them
from the main purpose of that miracle (though
it was wrought, and the <i>sign</i> given, for their
future information and recollection) and turns
their attention on another and very remote
circumstance, <i>the efficacy of faith</i> to enable
them to work this and greater miracles<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>. But
it was a <i>general</i> rule with our Lord to consult
the infirmities of his disciples, and to communicate
to them only so much of his purposes
and councils, as they could bear; leaving the
rest to be collected by them, in due time, from
casual hints and obscure passages, when they
should afterwards call them to mind, and be
in a condition, under the influence of the holy
Spirit, to profit by them. Thus, in John xvi.
12. <i>I have yet many things to say to you, but</i>
<small>YE CANNOT BEAR THEM NOW</small>: and then refers
them to the spirit of truth, for further information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span></p>

<p>Connected with this tenderness for his disciples,</p>

<p>2. A <i>further</i> reason, without doubt, was a
prudential regard to the general <i>success</i> of his
ministry, with the rest of the Jews.</p>

<p>For that great event, the call of the Gentiles,
was not to take place during the life of
Jesus; <i>who was sent only to the lost sheep of
the house of Israel</i><a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>; that is, he was <i>personally</i>
to address himself only to <small>THEM</small>; the
conversion of the Heathen being to be effected,
after his ascension, by the ministry of his
Apostles and followers. Hence, had our Saviour
plainly unfolded this secret to the Jews,
he would certainly have indisposed them for
paying any regard to his mission. And yet,
so important a part of his character was not to
be wholly concealed. It was therefore signified
in this covert way; and (being itself a prophecy
of something yet to be deferred) in the
mode, and with the usual obscurity, of a prophetic
information.</p>

<p>What I have just now observed of the caution
with which our Lord revealed his purpose of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
calling the Gentiles, explains the reason why
St. John’s account of the <i>first</i> transaction in
the temple, differs so much from that which
the other Evangelists give of the <i>second</i>. Jesus
had just entered on his prophetic office,
when he used the <i>sign</i> of purging the temple,
of which St. John speaks: he therefore leaves
the Jews to their own interpretation of that
sign, saying only, <i>Take these things hence;
make not my Father’s house an house of merchandize</i>;
as though a zeal for that house had
been his sole inducement to make use of it:
and accordingly the disciples, as I before observed,
so understood him. But, when he
thought fit to employ this <i>significative action</i>
a second time, of which the other Evangelists
only speak, his ministry was then drawing to
a conclusion. So that he is now less scrupulous
of giving offence, and does all but directly
interpret the sign himself, by referring his
hearers to the prophecy of Isaiah, which was
the proper key to it—<i>He taught them, saying,
Is it not written, My house shall be called
the house of prayer for all the nations</i><a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>?
Still, there was some obscurity, which he did
not think fit altogether to remove: but he had
said enough to correct their former hasty conclusion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
For we are not told by those other
Evangelists, as we are by St. John, that the
disciples considered what they had seen their
Master do, as a pure act of <i>zeal</i> for the honour
of the temple: the prophecy, without doubt,
suggested something to their minds, which led
them to apprehend a farther and higher purpose
in that transaction.</p>

<p>3. Lastly, we may suppose, that the information
was given in this <i>symbolic way</i>, that,
when men saw the event, they might be the
more strongly convinced of its being Christ’s
intention it should come to pass, by calling to
mind the sensible and striking manner, in
which it had been predicted by him.</p>

<p>For these, or other reasons, the method here
employed by Christ to signify his intended
favour to the Gentiles, might be most proper.
In the mean time, as I said, this intention was
not wholly to be concealed: for then the call
of the Gentiles might be deemed an afterthought,
and not to have been originally in his
commission. Accordingly, it is intimated very
frequently in our Lord’s discourses to the Jews,
and opened more clearly on many occasions to
his Apostles; and was, in truth, so much in
his view, and so constantly present to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
that, as we now find, it was one of the <i>first</i>,
and <i>last</i> things he did, to go into the temple,
and, by an expressive sign, to declare his gracious
purpose towards the Heathen.</p>

<p>We may, further, observe (so intent was
The Divine Providence on gradually unveiling
<i>the glory of this mystery</i><a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>, as St. Paul terms
it) that the moment our blessed Lord expired
on the cross, <i>the veil of the temple was rent
in twain from the top to the bottom</i>: a <i>sign</i>,
to some purpose, of that great event which
Jesus had foretold, and which God himself
held forth to the astonished Jews, as the clearest
emblem of his purposed favour to the Gentiles;
when the Sanctuary itself, as well as the outermost
court of their temple, was thus laid open
to the access, and vindicated to the use, of all
nations.</p>

<p><i>Finally</i>, in due time, this purpose was clearly
and explicitly made known to Peter, in his
famous vision: and thus it pleased God to reveal
this adorable mystery, “The salvation of
the Gentile world,” (which, though not the
<i>immediate</i>, was the most important end of
Christ’s commission) by every mode of communication,
which he had ever employed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
his intercourse with mankind; by the <i>word of
prophecy</i>—by <i>similitudes</i>, <i>by the hand of
Jesus</i>—by an <i>extraordinary sign from heaven</i>—and
by <i>Vision</i>.</p>

<p>After so minute a commentary on this famous
act of <i>Christ’s driving the buyers and
sellers out of the temple</i>, may I be permitted
to conclude, that it, now, stands clear of those
difficulties, which have been usually found
it?—It was no indecent start of zeal in our
Lord: it was no violent invasion of the rights
of any: it was no act of civil authority, usurped
by him: but a <i>prophetic information</i>, conveyed
in a <i>prophetic form</i>, of an event, the
most important to mankind, and to the accomplishment
of his own office and ministry. It
was a calm, rational, inoffensive act; not unworthy
the person of our blessed Lord; or,
rather, full of that wisdom, which adorned his
character, and shone out in all his conduct and
conversation.</p>

world. His words are—τὴν μὲν φιλοσοφίαν τὴν Ἑλληνικὴν
ἐὰν ὁ τυχὼν ἄρχων κωλύσῃ, οἴχεται παραχρῆμα· [Clemens Alexandr.
Strom. L. vi. p. 827. Oxon. 1715.] Perhaps, the
learned father was mistaken. But a religion, founded on
facts, not on opinions, and persecuted from the beginning,
could not have supported itself, if those facts had
been false. This is the case of Christianity. The subsequent
persecutions, when the truth of Christianity was
admitted on the credit of the first martyrs, might tend to
advance this religion, even though it had been originally
an imposture. The difference of the two cases is palpable.
The Apostles shewed, by their sufferings, that they <i>knew</i>
what they attested to be a true fact: Succeeding sufferers
shewed, that they <i>believed</i> it to be so.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
